"Hyderabad: The Telangana government has assured that it would implement multiple steps to improve the 26,065 state-run schools through the ‘Mana Ooru Mana Badi’ scheme over three years, from building basic infrastructure to providing digital classrooms, as well as starting instruction in English medium.
If the government’s ambitious project comes to fruition, it would not be a moment too soon. Several schools are in dire straits and gasping for help.
 
This reporter travelled to government, zilla and mandal parishad schools in the interiors, in tribal tracks and in towns surrounding headquarters of multiple districts. All over, schools were in need of basic facilities. Just ahead of their reopening after the summer vacation, these schools seem to have been left out of the government's programme.
Schools face the same problem — dilapidated classrooms, unkempt premises, unhygienic toilets, no provision for drinking water, missing compound walls as well as lack of staff to maintain hygiene.
 
Multiple schools have students of different classes taught by one or two common teachers. There is a lack of focus on providing study materials and having teaching aids. There are no libraries and there are no laboratories in many cases.
There is no emphasis on imparting social and extra-curricular activities, which are crucial for the overall development of a student. In any case, there are no facilities for the children to play. Schools lack sporting equipment.
Students are forced to make do with the few facilities available to them. While ministers and TRS MLAs heap praises on the functioning of government schools, repeatedly claiming that they have the best facilities, the reality seems to be different altogether as Deccan Chronicle found out.
 
Schools located close to the district headquarters and Zilla Parishad High Schools (ZPHS) in mandal quarters are better maintained, with facilities such as potable drinking water, clean surroundings, good decoration, artworks on walls and others.
Maintenance of schools is a different story altogether, with staff shortage affecting cleaning of toilets, upkeep of school premises and watering of plants, among others.
In 2022, the government had allocated Rs 16,043 crore to the education sector, up from Rs 15,608 crore last year. The budget has been divided, with Rs 13,727 given for school education and Rs 2,357 crore for higher education.
 
In order to uplift facilities in government schools, Rs 7,289.54 has been allotted to the Mana Ooru Mana Badi programme. In the first phase, Rs 3,497 crore is to be spent to develop 9,123, or 35 per cent, of state-run schools.
When students step into their classrooms in thousands of schools on Monday, however, they will find that there is a long way to go. This reporter tried to get in touch with the district education officers concerned and the constituency MLAs via phone calls and emails but none of them responded.
Aged woman offers her hut for school
 
Komaram Bheem Asifabad: The small hamlet of Jandaguda in Ullipitta village of Tiryani mandal is home to around 30 Adivasi families. These families were relocated by Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in 2007 to Pangadi which is located in the deep forests, without roads and electricity, and a school. .
For 10 years, the school was run from the hut of a cook, Jekam Pochubai. In 2018, hoping for a better life, they relocated to Jandaguda but did not get a school building, and continued to use Pochubai’s hut.
“We cannot afford to send our kids to private schools. For a long time, we did not have proper roads or electricity. There is no school. We are constantly fighting for a dignified life,” a resident said.
“We relocated to this area hoping for a better future for our kids. Through lots of efforts, we were able to get an anganwadi school with the help of social activists. However, this has not been inaugurated yet.”
Pochubai said, “I have offered my hut because I want to see the children of our village get an education. I cook meals for them. It would be really great if the government provides better facilities and a proper school here.”
The teacher, Ada Venkatesh was recently transferred to Jandaguda. ""The situation is not favourable. When it rains, we cancel classes because water leaks through the roof. The previous teachers had urged officials to look into the issues that students face but there has been no action.
The upper primary school with 25 students has one teacher who teaches all subjects. This school lacks a water connection and has portable toilets, one of which is dysfunctional. A borewell is the only source of water.
The power meter was stolen from the school in Ullipitta in March. The teacher and attender discovered this theft when they visited the school on June 2.
“I filed a complaint with the officials as well as the village MPP, who said they will look into the matter. The school has a pending bill of Rs. 40,000, which has not been paid since 10-12 years,” said Subash Rathod, the school’s teacher and incharge HM.
Officials at the power office told Deccan Chronicle they were not aware of who stole the meter.
Villagers highlighted the need for better transport, well trained staff, drinking water and others, stating that due to a lack of these, they are sometimes forced to send their kids to the headquarters, some 15km away, to an English medium school.
“If there are better facilities in our locality, life would be much easier for our kids who have to take a shared autorickshaw everyday for such a long distance to attend school,"" they said, adding that the teachers in Badi Bata programme were urged to ensure that school is converted into English medium. This, they said, would enable them to send their kids to schools, provided that the facilities get a facelift.
The school in Dorli faces similar issues, and the building is dilapidated.
Tiryani and Rebbana incharge mandal education officer (MEO) Venkateshwara Swamy admitted that most of these schools were not in good condition. “Senior officials have been intimated about these issues orally as well through the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE). We are yet to see any response since many years,” he said.
“I’m aware that many schools have payment arrears, particularly power dues. Many of these dues have piled up over the years. We cannot repay them at once since the funds received from the government are inadequate,” Swamy said.
When asked about Jandaguda school, he said the issue was to be taken care of by the Integrated Tribal Develpment Authority (ITDA). “We provide the UDISE report to the department as well as the state government. We have stated about this issue many times but nothing has changed,” he said.
He said that in Rebbena mandal, schools in Paikajiguda and Rajaram were also in a dilapidated condition since the last five years. “Two-three schools have collapsed and we are operating the schools out in villagers' homes. Every year, the government asks for the report on dilapidated schools. We mention this every time but since my time here no works have been sanctioned. Instead, the government tells us not to conduct classes in dilapidated buildings. We will be blamed in case of any mishap,” Swamy added.
Schools in Durgapur and Kannepalli villages of Tiriyani mandal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district also face similar issues.
 
For three years, school being run from a hut
Komaram Bheem Asifabad: A primary school in Rallabanjara, a remote village in Dammapeta mandal, functions out of a hut. The dilapidated school building was pulled down three years ago. There are over 20 students in the school.
Dammapeta mandal education officer Lakshmi told Deccan Chronicle that construction works were underway. The hut set up as a temporary basis on the school's premises after physical classes began. She stated that funds had been issued from the mandal parishad. She said construction works were slated to be completed in three months.
Schools in Laxmidevipally mandal's Bhavoji Thanda school lack basic facilities. The boundary wall resembles one of a weather-beaten ancient structure. The MPPS in Kothuru faces waterlogging issues, creating an unhygienic, stinking atmosphere. At Mokallagumpu, the small GPS TW school building lies in neglect. No boundary walls, a poorly maintained toilet and walls covered with moss greet visitors.
 
Garbage is burnt in school compound
Siddipet: The Zilla Parishad High School at Mylaram in Warangal mandal of Siddipet district offers its 148 students poorly maintained toilets. The school lacks proper facilities to cook mid-day meals.
“There is no staff to clean the premises. The government has handed over the responsibility of cleaning and maintenance to the gram panchayat, works happen irregularly. The cost for this is sometimes borne by my colleagues and I. We pitch in to pay the cleaning staff occasionally,” said school headmaster Tamala Bhaskar.
These issues are being were reported to the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) from time to time, he said. “The last bit of development this school witnessed was five years ago when the compound wall was fixed. As there are no gas cylinders, we're forced to use wood fire to cook food for our students. The funds issued by the government are not adequate to provide for all students,"" Bhaskar said.
The ZPHS in Raipole has dysfunctional toilets with broken doors and unhygienic hand wash areas. Many taps in the wash area are also broken. The MPPS in Kolgur of Gajwel mandal has no decent toilets for boys.
Garbage is burnt inside the premises of the school at Chandapur in Thoguta mandal. The ZPHS in the mandal has no decent toilets for girl students. There is no water connection to the school, due to which hand-pumped borewells are used to get water. Officials also fail to maintain the school premises.
At Tukkapur in the same mandal is an MPPS with broken toilets. The school is located next to a main road but has no compound wall, leaving the kids open to danger.
 
Even after MLA visit, no funds for school
Rajanna Sircilla: A ZPHS building in Vemulawada municipal Ward No 1 at Shatrajpally with 56 students is on the verge of collapse. The students are no strangers to poor toilets, broken benches or bad infrastructure. The classrooms have broken benches, adding to the discomfort of students. On the health and hygiene front, things are bleak as well as. It’s not just the students but the teachers who suffer as well, as there are four tables for a total of eight teachers.
A headmaster told Deccan Chronicle on the condition of anonymity: “As we don’t have workers, we are unable to keep the school clean. We only have around 25 benches for students to sit on and for tables for teachers. There are other issues as well.”
He said that every year, the school reported these issues to the UDISE and took the issue to the notice of the local MLA and officials but no funds were not allocated. “The MLA visited our school and assured that he would ensure the school is selected in the second phase of Mana Ooru Mana Badi. Vemulawada municipal mandal Ellanthkunta and Musthabad incharge MEO Bhukya Bannaji, “We have always mentioned these issues to senior officials and also reported to the UDISE but no action was taken. We need at least around 50 new dual desk-benches and many other things.”
He said supervision of mandal schools was difficult, and it was not possible to take special care and resolve all the issues.
The Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS) at Nerella in Thangallapalli mandal has small toilets with no roof, the ZPHS in Adavisrirampur of Peddapalli district is also hit by similar issues.
 
School in poor state, it’s now a cattle shed
Mancherial: Things are no better at the primary school in Ponnaram of Mandamarri mandal in Mancherial district. While this school too does not have facilites, it is used as a cattle shed.
The building has three rooms, but the 26 students are forced to study in one room as the conditions are pathetic in the other rooms.
This school is located a few metres away from the ZPHS.
Headmistress Sunitha said, “Even the room that's being used is constantly under repair. We rely on gram panchayat workers for cleaning but they're not regular. Many times, we pool money and pay these workers. The fund provided by the government is sufficient to pay electricity bills mostly. There is other expenditure for which we are short of funds.”
Sunitha said that in 2015, the school was approved a kitchen shed. Construction work stopped since the government did not clear the bills.
Incharge Mandal Education Officer Jadi Pochaiah said, “Every year in September, we file a UDISE report highlighting the issues but there is no action from the government.”
In the Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS), teachers pool `3,000 and hire workers to clean the schools.  “The fund which we get from the government is not enough to pay the electricity bills. It is not even sufficient to buy items for decorating the school for Republic Day and Independence Day.”
The Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS) at Mandamarri for a change is well-maintained but the boys toilet doors are broken, and the conditions are themselves dirty.
 
Toilet so bad it’s abandoned
Jangaon: The primary school in Hanuman thanda of Zaffergadh mandal has 12 students in different classes, who share one classroom and are taught by a single teacher. Facilities are in poor shape; the toilets are abandoned as they lack doors and have no water connection.
Students and staff members relieve themselves outside the school's premises.
There is no boundary wall enclosing the school.
Girls forced to use dirty toilets
Nizamabad: Classrooms at a school in Joorpur, Nandipet mandal, are on the verge of collapse. Here as well, toilets lack doors and water connection. Students, particularly girls, are forced to use unhygienic toilets.
Adding to the woes, the school lacks power supply and drinking water.

"Hyderabad: Much before the onset of monsoon, in the midsummer, city hospitals received a large number of acute gastroenteritis cases, caused by viral infections, with some cases also needing hospitalisation, according to the medical fraternity in the state capital. The hospitals had also started receiving dengue cases, which were expected to rise sharply in monsoon season, it said.
Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and nausea and vomiting, sometimes associated with fever. Professor and head of paediatric department, Niloufer Hospital, Dr T. Usha Rani said the hospital had regularly received multiple cases of diarrhoea caused by viral gastroenteritis over the past two to three months.
 
“The infection is usually seen during the intervening time between seasons. Even babies aged 7-8 month who are breastfed are also getting infected. But most cases don’t need hospitalisation and are manageable at home,” she said.
Medical director, senior consultant and laparoscopic surgeon at SLG Hospitals Dr Pradeep Panigrahi said of late, gastroenteritis was appearing as a symptom for most viral infections. “We are getting as many as 7-8 cases per day, of which about 15 per cent are children,” Consultant and general physician at KIMS Hospitals Dr K. Shivaraj said the hospital had received about 10-15 cases of acute gastroenteritis in a week throughout the summer.
 
While monsoon is the peak season for dengue infections, even before the season, hospitals have been reportedly getting dengue cases. As per the National Centre for Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, until April 30, a total of 293 cases were recorded in Telangana. According to doctors, the number would have significantly risen in May.
Dr Panigrahi said among all patients with fever coming to SLG Hospitals, about 40 per cent of them were being found to have dengue. The hospital was getting about 7-8 dengue cases in a week. Dr Shivaraj said as a couple of dengue cases were recently found, KIMS was now testing every patient with fever for dengue.
 
Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospital, said the pre monsoon rains and sudden dips in extreme temperatures had helped mosquito breeding and multiplied the chances for dengue transmission. “If this is the situation before monsoon, we can expect very high numbers in and post monsoon,” he added.

"Nellore: Prime Minister Narendra Modi heaped praise on Markapuram Rambhupal Reddy of Andhra Pradesh during 89th episode of Mann Ki Baat for donating all his earnings after retirement for the education of girls.
“He got accounts opened for about 100 daughters under the 'Sukanya Samridhi Yojana', and deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in it,” PM said.
 
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a small deposit scheme of the central government meant exclusively for girls, to meet the education and marriage expenses of those from poor families.
“My dear countrymen, the mantra of serving the society by rising above the self is a part of our values, our sanskar. Countless people in our country are making this mantra their life’s goal. I came to know about Rambhupal Reddyji, a friend living in Markapuram, Andhra Pradesh. He has donated all his earnings after retirement for the education of (our) daughters,” the PM noted.
 
A resident of Yadavalli village in Giddalur mandal in Prakasam district, generosity is the hallmark of Ram Bhupal, 61, who had worked as a teacher and retired in August last year.
While he deposited his entire retirement benefits for the education of 100 deserving girls he had identified for the help at the end of his service, he had encouraged the students of backward social groups by conducting special classes for them and providing study material to them right from the beginning of his teaching career.
As president of Pachayath Raj teachers association, Rambhupal Reddy also used to motivate good teachers. He was a recipient of the Best Teacher Award from former CMs Rajasekhar Reddy and Chandrababu Naidu.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, Rambhupal said he did not aim at publicity when he deposited his retirement benefits of Rs 25 lakh to support needy girl students.  “If you do service without any expectation, recognition will come to you in normal course,” Reddy said after the PM referred to his name in the Maan Ki Baat programme.
He said there is no limit to desires. Minimum of one’s earnings is enough to lead a normal life. Hence, he deposited amounts under the SSY scheme to help the girls. He had selected girls only from BPL families though he faced pressure from some other people too to select their children, he said.

"Hyderabad: Liquor brands with a maximum retail price (MRP) of less than Rs 200 became costly by Rs 20 to Rs 80 following orders of the state government on Thursday. The price of brands costing more than Rs 200 were increased in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 160.
Beer was made costlier by Rs 10 across all brands and bottle sizes, under the new orders. The orders stated that the revised prices were applicable even for stocks with old MRP printed on them.
 
Interestingly, the orders claimed that the price increase would lead to moderation in the consumption of liquor. This was seen to counter the criticism that the government had increased the prices to increase its revenues. The sudden price rise led to arguments between liquor shop dealers and consumers according to reports from several parts of the state.
Consumers refused to pay more than the MRP. Dealers struggled to convince them by displaying the government’s orders. The new price list is available on the website www.tsbcl.telangana.gov.in/ts/
 
Liquor prices were last increased in  the state in May 2020. The orders stated that, “Strict action shall be initiated against dealers violating the MRP. Any such instance may be reported on toll free number 18004252523

"Hyderabad: Legislators from Telangana State are the highest-paid compared to their counterparts from all other states, including by way of salaries and allowances.
While a Telangana MLA takes home a cool Rs 2.50 lakh every month, an MLA from Tripura draws a measly Rs 17,500. A legislator from Delhi commands the next highest at Rs 2.10 lakh while those from Andhra Pradesh draw a monthly salary of Rs 1.30 lakh.
 
Telangana MLAs shot to the top of the ladder in 2016 when the state government hiked their pay and allowances by an overwhelming 163 per cent in one go.
Apart from these, family members of an MLA are entitled for a host of other benefits. Each legislator gets an accommodation allowance of Rs 25,000 per month if he does not stay in MLAs hostel. Accommodation, and water and electricity supplies are free in MLA quarters.
They enjoy massive concessions and benefits when they travel by trains or TSRTC buses.  MLAs are eligible for a car advance of Rs 30 lakh or the actual cost of the vehicle, whichever is less, in each term.
MLAs and their family members are entitled to free accommodation and treatment in any hospital maintained by the state government.  Hospitalisation and treatment charges incurred by them, including abroad, are duly reimbursed.
 
An MLA can appoint a personal assistant on deputation from any one of 13 departments up to the cadre of senior assistant. The PA will draw salary from the parent department.
Legislators from the state also draw substantial amounts as monthly pension up to a maximum of Rs 70,000.
The spouse of a deceased MLA, who is not married, will be entitled to receive the same amount of the pension, which the MLA would have been entitled to if alive.
However, there are conflicting arguments on whether MLAs deserve such high salaries and allowances. They have also drawn all-round ridicule from certain quarters.
 
""Contrary to general perceptions not all MLAs are rich. Many from BC, SC, ST and minority categories are poor. Many former legislators approach the government and NGOs for financial support,"" pointed out R. Krishnaiah, former MLA.
""There should be a rationale. When MLAs in other states can work for less than Rs 20,000 per month, why should those from Telangana get Rs 2.50 lakh?"" asked M. Padmanabha Reddy, secretary of Forum for Good Governance.

"HYDERABAD: India could be in the middle of a silent but unfolding disaster in its farmlands and fruit gardens because of a steady decline in honey bee population across the country, which could lead to a severe setback to the country’s food production.
Agriculture scientists, entomologists, apiculture experts and pesticide industry managers, have called for urgent studies to understand the real situation on honey bee health and populations across the country.
 
Almost 80 per cent of all crops and most fruit-bearing trees require pollination.
Studies have shown that honey bees are responsible for up to 75 per cent of all pollination that keeps the crop production engine grinding in India, like elsewhere in the world. “Right now, it is a tragedy.
Something needs to be done before it turns into a catastrophe,” said P. Ravindra Kumar, director of apiculture technology centre at Prof Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University in Hyderabad, on the status of honey bees in the country. While there are no nation-wide concerted studies to understand the bee population distribution, anecdotal evidence shows that the numbers of beehives are falling.
 
“When I started the apiculture programme at NIRD (now the National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj) in 2004, I used to see several beehives. Today, I hardly see any,” Kumar told Deccan Chronicle.
This is the situation in an area of the city that is full of trees, flowering plants, and is the hub of agriculture training and teaching in the state. One of the biggest drivers of the fall in honey bee population, as also other pollinating insects, is the indiscriminate use of pesticides in the country, with factors like heat-induced stress from rising temperatures because of climate change and radiation from cell phone towers, particularly in urban areas, contributing to their decline.
 
According to Prof Parthib Basu, who leads the centre for agroecology & pollination studies at the University of Calcutta, “honey bees, the flagship pollinator species, are under tremendous physiological stress in agro-eco systems.”
Pesticides and other agrochemicals such as herbicides and weedicides are killing bees and other pollinators, especially in intensively farmed areas.
Also of great concern is the impact of manifestations of sub-lethal pesticide doses the bees and other pollinating insects are exposed to. “In such cases, the bees don’t die immediately but will drop off. There are behavioural aberrations, they lose their ability to smell, can no longer see properly, which affects their orientation for foraging and returning to their hives,” he said. In addition to bees, Prof Basu said that there are hundreds of other non-flagship pollinators.
 
“They are also under tremendous stress. Perhaps we are losing this diversity without anyone noticing it,” he said. “Our research,” he said “has shown that pollinators get killed along with pests. This essentially brings down productivity because you are letting go of pollinators.”
Declaring that there is no such thing as a safe pesticide, Prof Basu said when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced, they entered India in a big way about a decade ago. They were initially thought to be safe for friendly pollinator insects but now it is known that they are equally harmful. “There are published reports that have shown that even the so-called bio-pesticides also have tremendous adverse effects on bees, at least at the sub-lethal levels,” he said.
 
Even if bees are affected at sub-lethal levels, their fall in health eventually contributes to the collapse of their colonies.

"HYDERABAD: India and China could well emerge as the biggest hotspots for new zoonotic viral diseases — those that spread from wildlife to other mammals —and very likely to humans over the next few decades if human pressure on forests continues to increase, driving increasing human wildlife interactions, the State of the World’s Forests 2022 report has said.
The report comes just days after a similar prediction was made in a research paper published in the journal ‘Nature’ which too said climate change-driven changes could see over the next 50 years more than 15,000 new cases of mammals transmitting viruses to other mammals.
 
The study says that at least 10,000 virus species have the capacity to infect humans. These, at present, according to the study ‘Climate change increases cross-species viral transmission risk’, are circulating silently in wild mammals.
The study warns that climate and land use change will produce new opportunities for viral sharing among previously geographically-isolated species of wildlife, which will result in zoonotic spillover, diseases spreading from animals to humans.
The study says this risk will be highest in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, and could see a rise of such viral disease transmission by 4,000 times.
 
Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a renewed concern over spread of zoonotic diseases, and this concern was reflected in the ‘State of the World’s Forests’ report. It said human health is closely connected to animal health, and the shared environment.
It has become apparent, the report said, that addressing the ecosystem-health dimension through responsible land-use planning and greater involvement of the forest and wildlife sectors and natural-resource managers is important. It called for continuous monitoring and surveillance, data-sharing and evidence-based decision-making to contain the threat.

"MANNANUR: The three-day Saileswaram Jatara that began on April 15 in Amrabad Tiger Reserve passed off peacefully, but not without its share of controversies.
With political patronage increasing for the festival, and with pressure from the government to allow everyone who wants to visit the temple during the jatara, this year’s entry fee collection turned into a mess with sudden orders from Hyderabad that the entry fee be scrapped, two days into the festival. An amount of Rs 1,000 was proposed to be deducted for private four-wheelers, and lower amounts for two-wheelers and autorickshaws from this year. Finally, orders were issued to halve the entry fee on the last day of the festival.
 
According to officials, no vehicle can be allowed into a tiger reserve without an entry fee, as per the rules of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, which governs all goings on in the country’s tiger reserves. The amount collected was desperately needed for a post-jatara cleanup, food and payments to the large number of volunteers, an official said, adding: “There will be a few tons of trash that will need to be picked up.”
This year there is an additional challenge of disposing tonsured hair, as many pilgrims are tonsuring their heads. When barbers were enquired about their plans to dispose of the waste, forest department staff were informed that the hair will be thrown in the surrounding forest or in the ‘gundam’, the pool of water formed by a waterfall near the temple. The barbers were then directed to carry sacks and to stuff the tonsured hair in it to be transported out of the tiger reserve for disposal.
 
Though entry into the forest area was originally planned to have been stopped at 6 p.m., this turned out to be impossible to implement as hundreds of vehicles began piling up near the entry point at Farhabad. The entire area, including the parking lots, the way to the temple and the location where shops and ‘anna dana satrams’ came up, was lit up with generators brought to the area.
A senior forest department official in Hyderabad said that a thorough review would be held sometime later this month to evaluate how to regulate the number of people entering forests for such events, and security measures inside Telangana’s wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves.

"What do we know about “stealth omicron” so far?
It’s an extra-contagious version of the omicron variant, but it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease.
 
Since it was first identified in November, BA.2 has been spreading around the globe, driving new surges in parts of Asia and Europe. It’s now the dominant coronavirus version in the U.S. and more than five dozen other countries.
It was given the “stealth” nickname because it looks like the earlier delta variant on certain PCR tests, says Kristen Coleman at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. The original omicron, by contrast, is easy to differentiate from delta because of a genetic quirk.
In rare cases, early research indicates BA.2 can infect people even if they’ve already had an omicron infection. COVID-19 vaccines appear just as effective against both kinds of omicron, offering strong protection against severe illness and death.
 
Health officials also are tracking other variants including XE — a combination of BA.2 and BA.1, the original omicron — that was first identified in January in the United Kingdom. The World Health Organization is keeping tabs on XE but has not yet deemed it a variant of concern or interest.

"Hyderabad: The famous King Koti palace, where the last Nizam stayed, on Monday turned into a war zone with scores of people, allegedly acting on behalf of jeweller Sukesh Gupta, an accused in several bank and land fraud cases, forcibly trying to gain entry into the palace and take its possession.
The Nazri Bagh Palace Trust, the custodian of the palace, had handed over the possession of the palace and issued delivery certificate to the Mumbai-based Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd on March 28 after the company completed the sale transaction. The company also got the registered sale deed released in its favour by clearing all the stamp duty arrears.
 
According to police, about 140 persons, some of them even carrying swords and lathis, tried to enter the palace and break open the gate using an earthmover. The city police acted swiftly and took about 40 people into custody while the others fled.
Assistant commissioner of police K. Venkat Reddy said a case of trespassing was registered against people who tried to enter the palace and an inquiry is on.
The hectic activity was seen at Narayanguda police station where both parties claiming possession of the property were summoned by the police. Interestingly, the representative of Sukesh Gupta at one stage proposed that the police take control of the palace and keep it in their custody till the dispute is resolved.
 
Significantly, the Enforcement Directorate had registered a case against Sukesh Gupta on charges of money laundering and selling the palace using fraudulent documents and fake sale deeds. A case with similar allegations is also underway in National Company Law Tribunal.
Rajesh Agarwal of Neeharika Infrastructure told this correspondent that Sukesh Gupta and Biyani had initially entered into an agreement with the trust and his company later invested Rs 70 crore, cleared all the arrears including the pending amount to be paid to the Trust and took possession of 28,000 square yards.
 
Agarwal also alleged that Sukesh Gupta’s men who were acting as directors had forged board resolutions and sold the property to another company with backdated sale deed. “However, the trust after receiving the full sale consideration handed over the possession to us,” Agarwal said, adding “attempts were being made to project as if we were not in possession.”
Agrawal also alleged that a city ruling party MLA had been helping Sukesh Gupta and presence of a confidant of the MLA and his demand to the police to release his men gave credence to these allegations.
 
“I saw a mob first damaged the yellow gate of Nizam-ki-Devdi with a JCB and around 130 to 140 men, one or two of them armed with swords and the others with lathis, barged into the gate,” said Mazhar Khan an automobile shop owner who was passing by.
Later after the police arrived and bolted the gate from inside many of them fled while some who were trying were caught and held in the police van, he said.
Meanwhile, Neeharika Infrastructure moved a lunch motion in the Telangana High Court seeking a direction to the police to not interfere in the case as it was a civil dispute. The court will take up the case for hearing on Tuesday.

"Hyderabad: Grossly compromising on the interests of the state and failing in their duty to protect government land parcels, revenue and municipal authorities have given up their decades-long legal fight over a prime piece of land located in the twin cities, estimated to be worth over Rs 1,500 crore, by granting the final layout right on it to a cooperative housing society, Deccan Chronicle has learnt.
Following a “request” made by a senior state government official, through a recent memo 976/Assn.III(1)/2019, GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar sanctioned a layout for 32 acres in Survey No 327 paiki of Shaikpet village in favour of S.N. Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society (popularly known as Sakkubainagar).
 
The GHMC commissioner's sanction came after its standing counsel submitted in the Telangana High Court that “according to the Municipal Corporation, Sy No. 327/paiki does not exist.”
Documentary evidence available with Deccan Chronicle revealed that different government agencies had taken a consistent stand for decades that Survey No. 327 paiki was a non-existent and fictitious survey number and that the only survey number available in the records — 327 — was government land. This view had been upheld by the judiciary at different points.
 
Incidentally, several cases filed by the state government claiming ownership of the land are still pending in the Telangana High Court and a “status quo” order has been in vogue in relation to this land parcel.
Inquiries by DC revealed that the Junior Civil Judge of the City Civil Court found discrepancies in the records submitted by the SN Society in an injunction suit and categorically said the land belonged to the government. The society filed the first appeal before the Additional Chief Judge, who upheld the Junior Civil Judge’s order. The society filed a second appeal in the High Court, which is still pending.
 
In another case on the same land, the society obtained an order from a single judge of the High Court to not dispossess them from the land but the government filed a writ appeal before the bench challenging the single judge’s orders. That case is also pending.
Meanwhile, the Additional Advocate General recommended to the government to initiate a suit for declaration of title in favour of the government and Hyderabad district revenue authorities actively pursued the case. The senior official who lobbied for the layout sanction referred to High Court orders in his memo apparently to justify his action but conveniently ignored that the court had made an observation in the same order that the state government may follow due process — initiate a title suit for ownership —  to take possession.
 
Sources said the Hyderabad district authorities had succeeded in getting the state government to issue orders entrusting the title suitcase to the Advocate General, who had prepared a draft plaint and sent it to the Hyderabad district collector who, in turn, sent it to the Special Chief Secretary, Revenue, for his approval.
Several reminders were sent to Special CS, Revenue, in the last two years, to approve the AG’s plea and pursue the case further in the High Court. Yet, the recommendation for sanctioning the layout was sent to the GHMC.
 
What is intriguing is that one D. K. Narayana Rao, a retired Osmania University employee, applied to obtain for information pertaining to the layout under the Right to Information Act (RTI) but the GHMC information officers categorically asserted in their reply that “it was a 20-year-old record and was not found in the available layout records.”
Within days of the officials saying had no records of the land parcel, the GHMC commissioner cleared the same file in favour of SN Society.
“When Hyderabad district authorities came to know that the society had applied for layout clearance, the collector wrote to the GHMC to not sanction any layout as the state government was fighting for the prime property,” sources said, adding that this correspondence too was ignored and layout approval given to the society.

"HYDERABAD:  A team of workers from Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, has been working at the Yadadri temple complex for four months, installing the golden Kalasams and the gold-plated sanctum sanctorum. As many as 1,050 workers have been roped in for the key works at the new Yadadri temple.
Of the total 1,050 members, over 50 workers have been toiling hard at the sanctum sanctorum. ""We have been working here for three to four months now. Some of us have been involved in the gold plating works while most have been assigned with designing and installing the Kalasams,"" said a Tamil Nadu-based worker.
 
However, additional workers have been brought from Thanjavur in the last one week to meet the deadline before the reopening of the renovated temple.

"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao's dream project, the renovation of Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy temple in Yadadri, 70 km away from the city, has turned a visual treat on Saturday with every corner of the main temple hall being illuminated with colourful lights. While the 52 golden Kalasams on top of the gopurams add to the glory of the shrine, the new temple also has eye-catching chandeliers and special lighting.
The Chief Minister will inaugurate the renovated temple complex on Monday. With a blend of Pallava, Chalukya, Dravidian and Kakatiya styles of architecture, the temple features four mini temples and 12 wonderfully carved pillars which are the main attraction in the spacious hall measuring around 54 feet length and 36 feet in width.
 
The pillars, with sculptures of Alvars or poet-saints, are designed to enhance the aesthetic charm along the devotees’ queue line.
Eleven chandeliers - seven of them massive and four smaller – add to the exuberance of spiritual experience inside the new temple. Also, the main hall has been engineered in such a way that there is natural light and ventilation.  
An exclusive queue complex is being built, and it is in the final stages. The complex has four floors, each of which consists of two waiting halls. At any point, around 2,000 devotees can stand in the queue on each floor of the complex having a capacity of 8,000.
 
After darshan, devotees will be directed to a staircase across the hall that leads them outside the hall towards the Dwaja Stambha, through a massive 15-foot dwara.      
VIP darshan has a completely different route, with access to two separate elevators from across the lane along the presidential suites, and a passage to reach the main temple through massive dwara (doors) on the structure’s left hand side. On either side of the main hall, balconies with access to separate elevators have been built for the convenience of VIPs and pundits. The two elevators will lead to the rooms built underneath the structure.
 
However, it is said that changes could be made to regular devotees' entry and exit routes as per Vaastu recommendations, sources said. “There could be slight changes adhering to Vaastu, '' they said.
A 15-foot passage around the hall for Pradakshinas provides a serene experience to the devotees, with the comfort of seating halls after darshan. There is also a spacious Narasimha Swamy Kalyana Mandapa towards the right-hand side of the main hall.

"Hyderabad: Film director S.S. Rajamouli's long-awaited ‘RRR’ hit the screens on Friday to packed houses, the biggest release after two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. The initial turnout seemed to quell fears on the direction the film industry would take in the post-pandemic era.
The film has secured special permission from the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments to hike ticket prices. In the black market, reports said, tickets went for Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 a piece for the 7 am show — permission has been given for five shows a day — at main theatres at RTC crossroads.
 
Pratusha, Srivalli, Deepu (names changed), a group of friends, took a day off from office for a college friends' reunion and watched 'RRR' at Prasad I-Max. To their surprise, they were able to meet some crew members of the movie.
At single-screen theatres, the scenes were riotous with fans garlanding cutouts of their favourite actors, showering flower petals and firing crackers.
V.L. Sridhar, of VLS Sridavi Theatre, Chilkalguda, said, all shows had been booked solid till Monday. The higher ticket prices had made producers, exhibitor and distributors.
 
Yellina Jitendra Rambabu, a cinema analyst, said, “The opening collections and the fanfare as a whole reassure that the industry has a positive future.”
Producer Vishnu Induri, who has bankrolled films like N.T. Rama Rao’s biopic, ‘Jayalalithaa’, ‘83’, said the film industry was badly hit by the pandemic and films like ‘RRR’ would bring back hope and prompt filmmakers to continue to think big.
""It gives impetus for filmmakers' to make more pan-India films, narrate patriotic stories and initiate multi-starrers. It’s a fantastic and healthy trend,"" said Vishnu.
 
The performance of low-budget films like ‘The Kashmir Files’, which has raked in more than Rs 200 crore so far despite low expectations, is very difficult to comprehend, he said.
For producer-distributor Abhishek Nama, things boiled down to content. He said films like ‘RRR’ will attract the audience to theatres for the cinematic experience but content was important.
“What's heartening is that people are coming to cinema theatres post the pandemic. That's the need of the hour,"" elucidates Abhishek
 
While producers have recovered the film’s budget thanks to distribution, satellite and digital sales touching Rs 600 crore, it will be a challenge for distributors and exhibitors to earn the money back from ticket sales.
Director Mahi, who made ‘Yatra’ the biopic on YS Raja Sekhar Reddy, said that the trade business post the Covid era will be multi-layered. Film-makers may make films that are dedicated to either theatrical releases or OTTs.
Interestingly, producer Suresh Babu said it was too early to predict the pattern of audiences flocking theatres. He felt there was some unhappiness with the higher ticket prices.
 
“It’s premature to comment,” Suresh Babu told Deccan Chronicle. “Films like RRR are very rare, and hence people would love to watch it in theatres. But ‘The Kashmir Files’ has been the surprise package for me; it has caught the attention of the nation. Still, we need to wait and watch the theatrical scenario.""

"Hyderabad: A citizen who took IndiGo Airlines to consumer court after he missed a flight had to attend 15 hearings in the court here, but he won the case by a Rs 1 lakh compensation payment order.
Didugu Suresham and his daughter had missed their flight from Hyderabad to Kolkata as there was a delay in printing their boarding passes, though they had been allotted seats. As a result, they missed another connecting flight from Kolkata to Jorhat, Assam, as well.
 
There was only one flight to Jorhat from Kolkata, which they missed. Suresham's daughter had to report in Jorhat the next morning for admission into a college.
Suresham then had to book two more Indigo flights -- from Hyderabad to Kolkata and then one from Kolkata to Guwahati, after which they had to travel by bus overnight to reach Jorhat the next morning. 
Suresham registered a complaint with the airline, seeking an apology, action against the executive responsible at the airport and refund of the amount they spent for their flights. The airline rejected the pleas. He then lodged a case against the airline before the district consumer disputes redressal commission – I, Hyderabad in December, 2019.
 
Suresham had to attend 15 court hearings over two years because counsel for the airline kept seeking more time to present his papers. 
However, the complainant says he was not required to arrange for an advocate as the case was a Party in Person (PIP) filing, and also said the procedure was consumer- friendly.
The court ordered IndiGo to pay the petitioner Rs 1 lakh as compensation for the ‘hardship and mental agony’ he faced. It also asked IndiGo to refund the amount paid extra towards alternative travel tickets, as well as pay Rs 20,000 towards costs of litigation.

"New Delhi: Amid the buzz surrounding the film, Kashmir Files, the Kerala unit of Congress claimed in a tweet, now deleted, that more Muslims were killed in Jammu and Kashmir during 1990-2007 than Pandits, inviting the wrath of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which called the statements ""insane"".
'Kashmir Files' has brought the spotlight on the killings and forced exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits from the valley after the Pakistan sponsored terrorists ran amok there in the late 1980s and afterwards.
 
The deleted tweet of the Kerala unit of the Congress posted from its official Twitter handle attempted to project a statistical perspective to the issue of the killings and exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits, arguing that 15000 Muslims were killed during 1990-2007 against 399 Pandits.
The Kerala Congress in another tweet, part of a series, claimed that over one lakh Muslims were killed in the erstwhile state in the wake of the communal riots (1948) after the partition of the country while no Pandits were killed in retaliation.
The tweets were posted with '#KashmiriPandit issue'.
 
The BJP, reacting sharply, said that ""Congress doesn't understand history"". ""...this is the most insane statement that Congress can make. Congress doesn't understand history... and they've hugely distorted the version of history. Under the watch of Congress dispensations, over a lakh Pandits left the valley,"" said former Union Minister and senior BJP leader K J Alphons.
The Kerala Congress also sought to shift the onus for the exodus to the BJP, saying ""the migration suited the agenda of the BJP for the Hindu-Muslim division while carrying out the Ram Mandir issue in Ayodhya"". Another tweet claimed that the then Jammu and Kashmir Governor Jagmohan was an RSS man, and he in place of providing security to the Pandits asked them to leave the valley en masse.
 
""Pandits left the valley en masse under the direction of Governor Jagmohan who was an RSS man. The migration started under the BJP-supported VP Singh government,"" claimed the Kerala unit of Congress in another tweet, arguing further that the BJP supported VP Singh's government came to power in J&K in December 1989 and exodus began the very next month and BJP continued to support VP Singh till November 1990.

"The Telugu film Radhe Shyam starring Prabhas and Pooja Hegde, directed by Radha Krishna may have easily emerged as the highest opener in 2022 with a collection of Rs 72.41 crores across the country, but collections in the Hindi market were dented and hence the ‘pan India’ presence too took a beating.
Giving it tough competition is the film The Kashmir Files that has grown by 140% on the second day as compared to the collections of the first day.
 
Radhe Shyam’s opening day collections worldwide came to Rs 72.41, beating Bheemla Nayak and Valimai which stood at Rs 61.24 and Rs 59.28 respectively. But Radhe Shyam managed a Rs 48 crores all India collection.
Having said that, the Day one Collections in Hindi for Radhe Shyam stood at Rs 4.5 crores and collected Rs 5 crores on the second day totalling to Rs 9.5 crores in two days.
Pre-release business helps the film
While we steer away from the phenomenal Baahubali collections, let us tell you that the Prabhas starrer Saaho which was Prabhas’ next release after Baahubali: The Conclusion collected Rs 24.40 crores and the combined collections across all languages was Rs 140 crores.
 
“I will be surprised if this film collects a lot of money — will be happy if the producers recover their money,” Prabhas told us recently, clearly aware of the limitations of the romantic subject Radhe Shyam. The film has collected more than Rs 100 crore by the end of the second day.          
The pre-release business of Radhe Shyam was strong, where they reportedly cashed in more than Rs 200 crore from overseas, satellite and digital rights and sold the theatrical rights for over Rs 105 crore.  
 
Kashmir Files beats Prabhas
The Anupam Kher starrer The Kashmir Files which had managed a surprising Rs 3.55 crores on the first day registered a 140 % growth or more than double the collections on the second day and got Rs 8.50 crores ending up with Rs 12 crores in 2 days which is much more than the Radhe Shyam collections in India.
“The Kashmir Files has a lot more screens now and the film has had the highest ever growth for any film post covid era for the second day as compared to the first day. The film is growing by word of mouth,” informs Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh.
 
The Kashmir Files, directed by Agnihotri, narrates the plight of Kashmiri Pandits in the 90s. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi also met the team of The Kashmir Files and fiercely praised the film, many critics who have not appreciated the filmmaker’s right-wing leanings still went on to praise the film for not attempting to either whitewash the story or take sides.
The film was released first in 700 screens worldwide while Radhe Shyam released in more than 3000 screens.

"Mumbai: Actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu has an important message for the trollers who judge women by their outfits.
Samantha donned a beautiful deep neck gown to the Critics Choice Awards on March 10. Her photos and videos from the event went viral on social media on which a section of netizens trolled her for her choice of outfit.
 
Taking to her Instagram Story on Saturday, the actor slammed trollers who judged her by her outfit. She wrote a long note amid the backdrop of herself wearing the same outfit.
The note read, ""As a woman, I bear firsthand knowledge of what it means to be judged. We judged women based on what they wear, their race, education, social standing, appearance, skin tone and the list goes on and on. Making snap judgements about a person simply based on the clothes they wear is quite literally the easiest thing one can do.""
 
She further added, ""Now that we're in the year 2022-can we finally stop judging a woman based on the hemlines & necklines she adorns and focus on instead of bettering ourselves?""
""Turning that judgement inward and training it on ones own self is evolution! Projecting our ideals on someone else never did anyone any good...let's gently rewrite the way we measure and understand a person!"" she concluded with heart emoticons.
Talking about Samantha's upcoming projects, she is awaiting the release of her next film 'Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kaathal' alongside Vijay Sethupati and Nayanthara, which is slated for a theatrical release on April 28, 2022.
 
Apart from this, she also has the mythological film, 'Shakuntalam' in her kitty.

"Hyderabad: The Telangana government has assured that it would implement multiple steps to improve the 26,065 state-run schools through the ‘Mana Ooru Mana Badi’ scheme over three years, from building basic infrastructure to providing digital classrooms, as well as starting instruction in English medium.
If the government’s ambitious project comes to fruition, it would not be a moment too soon. Several schools are in dire straits and gasping for help.
 
This reporter travelled to government, zilla and mandal parishad schools in the interiors, in tribal tracks and in towns surrounding headquarters of multiple districts. All over, schools were in need of basic facilities. Just ahead of their reopening after the summer vacation, these schools seem to have been left out of the government's programme.
Schools face the same problem — dilapidated classrooms, unkempt premises, unhygienic toilets, no provision for drinking water, missing compound walls as well as lack of staff to maintain hygiene.
 
Multiple schools have students of different classes taught by one or two common teachers. There is a lack of focus on providing study materials and having teaching aids. There are no libraries and there are no laboratories in many cases.
There is no emphasis on imparting social and extra-curricular activities, which are crucial for the overall development of a student. In any case, there are no facilities for the children to play. Schools lack sporting equipment.
Students are forced to make do with the few facilities available to them. While ministers and TRS MLAs heap praises on the functioning of government schools, repeatedly claiming that they have the best facilities, the reality seems to be different altogether as Deccan Chronicle found out.
 
Schools located close to the district headquarters and Zilla Parishad High Schools (ZPHS) in mandal quarters are better maintained, with facilities such as potable drinking water, clean surroundings, good decoration, artworks on walls and others.
Maintenance of schools is a different story altogether, with staff shortage affecting cleaning of toilets, upkeep of school premises and watering of plants, among others.
In 2022, the government had allocated Rs 16,043 crore to the education sector, up from Rs 15,608 crore last year. The budget has been divided, with Rs 13,727 given for school education and Rs 2,357 crore for higher education.
 
In order to uplift facilities in government schools, Rs 7,289.54 has been allotted to the Mana Ooru Mana Badi programme. In the first phase, Rs 3,497 crore is to be spent to develop 9,123, or 35 per cent, of state-run schools.
When students step into their classrooms in thousands of schools on Monday, however, they will find that there is a long way to go. This reporter tried to get in touch with the district education officers concerned and the constituency MLAs via phone calls and emails but none of them responded.
Aged woman offers her hut for school
 
Komaram Bheem Asifabad: The small hamlet of Jandaguda in Ullipitta village of Tiryani mandal is home to around 30 Adivasi families. These families were relocated by Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in 2007 to Pangadi which is located in the deep forests, without roads and electricity, and a school. .
For 10 years, the school was run from the hut of a cook, Jekam Pochubai. In 2018, hoping for a better life, they relocated to Jandaguda but did not get a school building, and continued to use Pochubai’s hut.
“We cannot afford to send our kids to private schools. For a long time, we did not have proper roads or electricity. There is no school. We are constantly fighting for a dignified life,” a resident said.
“We relocated to this area hoping for a better future for our kids. Through lots of efforts, we were able to get an anganwadi school with the help of social activists. However, this has not been inaugurated yet.”
Pochubai said, “I have offered my hut because I want to see the children of our village get an education. I cook meals for them. It would be really great if the government provides better facilities and a proper school here.”
The teacher, Ada Venkatesh was recently transferred to Jandaguda. ""The situation is not favourable. When it rains, we cancel classes because water leaks through the roof. The previous teachers had urged officials to look into the issues that students face but there has been no action.
The upper primary school with 25 students has one teacher who teaches all subjects. This school lacks a water connection and has portable toilets, one of which is dysfunctional. A borewell is the only source of water.
The power meter was stolen from the school in Ullipitta in March. The teacher and attender discovered this theft when they visited the school on June 2.
“I filed a complaint with the officials as well as the village MPP, who said they will look into the matter. The school has a pending bill of Rs. 40,000, which has not been paid since 10-12 years,” said Subash Rathod, the school’s teacher and incharge HM.
Officials at the power office told Deccan Chronicle they were not aware of who stole the meter.
Villagers highlighted the need for better transport, well trained staff, drinking water and others, stating that due to a lack of these, they are sometimes forced to send their kids to the headquarters, some 15km away, to an English medium school.
“If there are better facilities in our locality, life would be much easier for our kids who have to take a shared autorickshaw everyday for such a long distance to attend school,"" they said, adding that the teachers in Badi Bata programme were urged to ensure that school is converted into English medium. This, they said, would enable them to send their kids to schools, provided that the facilities get a facelift.
The school in Dorli faces similar issues, and the building is dilapidated.
Tiryani and Rebbana incharge mandal education officer (MEO) Venkateshwara Swamy admitted that most of these schools were not in good condition. “Senior officials have been intimated about these issues orally as well through the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE). We are yet to see any response since many years,” he said.
“I’m aware that many schools have payment arrears, particularly power dues. Many of these dues have piled up over the years. We cannot repay them at once since the funds received from the government are inadequate,” Swamy said.
When asked about Jandaguda school, he said the issue was to be taken care of by the Integrated Tribal Develpment Authority (ITDA). “We provide the UDISE report to the department as well as the state government. We have stated about this issue many times but nothing has changed,” he said.
He said that in Rebbena mandal, schools in Paikajiguda and Rajaram were also in a dilapidated condition since the last five years. “Two-three schools have collapsed and we are operating the schools out in villagers' homes. Every year, the government asks for the report on dilapidated schools. We mention this every time but since my time here no works have been sanctioned. Instead, the government tells us not to conduct classes in dilapidated buildings. We will be blamed in case of any mishap,” Swamy added.
Schools in Durgapur and Kannepalli villages of Tiriyani mandal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district also face similar issues.
 
For three years, school being run from a hut
Komaram Bheem Asifabad: A primary school in Rallabanjara, a remote village in Dammapeta mandal, functions out of a hut. The dilapidated school building was pulled down three years ago. There are over 20 students in the school.
Dammapeta mandal education officer Lakshmi told Deccan Chronicle that construction works were underway. The hut set up as a temporary basis on the school's premises after physical classes began. She stated that funds had been issued from the mandal parishad. She said construction works were slated to be completed in three months.
Schools in Laxmidevipally mandal's Bhavoji Thanda school lack basic facilities. The boundary wall resembles one of a weather-beaten ancient structure. The MPPS in Kothuru faces waterlogging issues, creating an unhygienic, stinking atmosphere. At Mokallagumpu, the small GPS TW school building lies in neglect. No boundary walls, a poorly maintained toilet and walls covered with moss greet visitors.
 
Garbage is burnt in school compound
Siddipet: The Zilla Parishad High School at Mylaram in Warangal mandal of Siddipet district offers its 148 students poorly maintained toilets. The school lacks proper facilities to cook mid-day meals.
“There is no staff to clean the premises. The government has handed over the responsibility of cleaning and maintenance to the gram panchayat, works happen irregularly. The cost for this is sometimes borne by my colleagues and I. We pitch in to pay the cleaning staff occasionally,” said school headmaster Tamala Bhaskar.
These issues are being were reported to the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) from time to time, he said. “The last bit of development this school witnessed was five years ago when the compound wall was fixed. As there are no gas cylinders, we're forced to use wood fire to cook food for our students. The funds issued by the government are not adequate to provide for all students,"" Bhaskar said.
The ZPHS in Raipole has dysfunctional toilets with broken doors and unhygienic hand wash areas. Many taps in the wash area are also broken. The MPPS in Kolgur of Gajwel mandal has no decent toilets for boys.
Garbage is burnt inside the premises of the school at Chandapur in Thoguta mandal. The ZPHS in the mandal has no decent toilets for girl students. There is no water connection to the school, due to which hand-pumped borewells are used to get water. Officials also fail to maintain the school premises.
At Tukkapur in the same mandal is an MPPS with broken toilets. The school is located next to a main road but has no compound wall, leaving the kids open to danger.
 
Even after MLA visit, no funds for school
Rajanna Sircilla: A ZPHS building in Vemulawada municipal Ward No 1 at Shatrajpally with 56 students is on the verge of collapse. The students are no strangers to poor toilets, broken benches or bad infrastructure. The classrooms have broken benches, adding to the discomfort of students. On the health and hygiene front, things are bleak as well as. It’s not just the students but the teachers who suffer as well, as there are four tables for a total of eight teachers.
A headmaster told Deccan Chronicle on the condition of anonymity: “As we don’t have workers, we are unable to keep the school clean. We only have around 25 benches for students to sit on and for tables for teachers. There are other issues as well.”
He said that every year, the school reported these issues to the UDISE and took the issue to the notice of the local MLA and officials but no funds were not allocated. “The MLA visited our school and assured that he would ensure the school is selected in the second phase of Mana Ooru Mana Badi. Vemulawada municipal mandal Ellanthkunta and Musthabad incharge MEO Bhukya Bannaji, “We have always mentioned these issues to senior officials and also reported to the UDISE but no action was taken. We need at least around 50 new dual desk-benches and many other things.”
He said supervision of mandal schools was difficult, and it was not possible to take special care and resolve all the issues.
The Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS) at Nerella in Thangallapalli mandal has small toilets with no roof, the ZPHS in Adavisrirampur of Peddapalli district is also hit by similar issues.
 
School in poor state, it’s now a cattle shed
Mancherial: Things are no better at the primary school in Ponnaram of Mandamarri mandal in Mancherial district. While this school too does not have facilites, it is used as a cattle shed.
The building has three rooms, but the 26 students are forced to study in one room as the conditions are pathetic in the other rooms.
This school is located a few metres away from the ZPHS.
Headmistress Sunitha said, “Even the room that's being used is constantly under repair. We rely on gram panchayat workers for cleaning but they're not regular. Many times, we pool money and pay these workers. The fund provided by the government is sufficient to pay electricity bills mostly. There is other expenditure for which we are short of funds.”
Sunitha said that in 2015, the school was approved a kitchen shed. Construction work stopped since the government did not clear the bills.
Incharge Mandal Education Officer Jadi Pochaiah said, “Every year in September, we file a UDISE report highlighting the issues but there is no action from the government.”
In the Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS), teachers pool `3,000 and hire workers to clean the schools.  “The fund which we get from the government is not enough to pay the electricity bills. It is not even sufficient to buy items for decorating the school for Republic Day and Independence Day.”
The Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS) at Mandamarri for a change is well-maintained but the boys toilet doors are broken, and the conditions are themselves dirty.
 
Toilet so bad it’s abandoned
Jangaon: The primary school in Hanuman thanda of Zaffergadh mandal has 12 students in different classes, who share one classroom and are taught by a single teacher. Facilities are in poor shape; the toilets are abandoned as they lack doors and have no water connection.
Students and staff members relieve themselves outside the school's premises.
There is no boundary wall enclosing the school.
Girls forced to use dirty toilets
Nizamabad: Classrooms at a school in Joorpur, Nandipet mandal, are on the verge of collapse. Here as well, toilets lack doors and water connection. Students, particularly girls, are forced to use unhygienic toilets.
Adding to the woes, the school lacks power supply and drinking water.

"Hyderabad: Much before the onset of monsoon, in the midsummer, city hospitals received a large number of acute gastroenteritis cases, caused by viral infections, with some cases also needing hospitalisation, according to the medical fraternity in the state capital. The hospitals had also started receiving dengue cases, which were expected to rise sharply in monsoon season, it said.
Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and nausea and vomiting, sometimes associated with fever. Professor and head of paediatric department, Niloufer Hospital, Dr T. Usha Rani said the hospital had regularly received multiple cases of diarrhoea caused by viral gastroenteritis over the past two to three months.
 
“The infection is usually seen during the intervening time between seasons. Even babies aged 7-8 month who are breastfed are also getting infected. But most cases don’t need hospitalisation and are manageable at home,” she said.
Medical director, senior consultant and laparoscopic surgeon at SLG Hospitals Dr Pradeep Panigrahi said of late, gastroenteritis was appearing as a symptom for most viral infections. “We are getting as many as 7-8 cases per day, of which about 15 per cent are children,” Consultant and general physician at KIMS Hospitals Dr K. Shivaraj said the hospital had received about 10-15 cases of acute gastroenteritis in a week throughout the summer.
 
While monsoon is the peak season for dengue infections, even before the season, hospitals have been reportedly getting dengue cases. As per the National Centre for Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, until April 30, a total of 293 cases were recorded in Telangana. According to doctors, the number would have significantly risen in May.
Dr Panigrahi said among all patients with fever coming to SLG Hospitals, about 40 per cent of them were being found to have dengue. The hospital was getting about 7-8 dengue cases in a week. Dr Shivaraj said as a couple of dengue cases were recently found, KIMS was now testing every patient with fever for dengue.
 
Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospital, said the pre monsoon rains and sudden dips in extreme temperatures had helped mosquito breeding and multiplied the chances for dengue transmission. “If this is the situation before monsoon, we can expect very high numbers in and post monsoon,” he added.

"Nellore: Prime Minister Narendra Modi heaped praise on Markapuram Rambhupal Reddy of Andhra Pradesh during 89th episode of Mann Ki Baat for donating all his earnings after retirement for the education of girls.
“He got accounts opened for about 100 daughters under the 'Sukanya Samridhi Yojana', and deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in it,” PM said.
 
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a small deposit scheme of the central government meant exclusively for girls, to meet the education and marriage expenses of those from poor families.
“My dear countrymen, the mantra of serving the society by rising above the self is a part of our values, our sanskar. Countless people in our country are making this mantra their life’s goal. I came to know about Rambhupal Reddyji, a friend living in Markapuram, Andhra Pradesh. He has donated all his earnings after retirement for the education of (our) daughters,” the PM noted.
 
A resident of Yadavalli village in Giddalur mandal in Prakasam district, generosity is the hallmark of Ram Bhupal, 61, who had worked as a teacher and retired in August last year.
While he deposited his entire retirement benefits for the education of 100 deserving girls he had identified for the help at the end of his service, he had encouraged the students of backward social groups by conducting special classes for them and providing study material to them right from the beginning of his teaching career.
As president of Pachayath Raj teachers association, Rambhupal Reddy also used to motivate good teachers. He was a recipient of the Best Teacher Award from former CMs Rajasekhar Reddy and Chandrababu Naidu.
 
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, Rambhupal said he did not aim at publicity when he deposited his retirement benefits of Rs 25 lakh to support needy girl students.  “If you do service without any expectation, recognition will come to you in normal course,” Reddy said after the PM referred to his name in the Maan Ki Baat programme.
He said there is no limit to desires. Minimum of one’s earnings is enough to lead a normal life. Hence, he deposited amounts under the SSY scheme to help the girls. He had selected girls only from BPL families though he faced pressure from some other people too to select their children, he said.

"Hyderabad: Liquor brands with a maximum retail price (MRP) of less than Rs 200 became costly by Rs 20 to Rs 80 following orders of the state government on Thursday. The price of brands costing more than Rs 200 were increased in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 160.
Beer was made costlier by Rs 10 across all brands and bottle sizes, under the new orders. The orders stated that the revised prices were applicable even for stocks with old MRP printed on them.
 
Interestingly, the orders claimed that the price increase would lead to moderation in the consumption of liquor. This was seen to counter the criticism that the government had increased the prices to increase its revenues. The sudden price rise led to arguments between liquor shop dealers and consumers according to reports from several parts of the state.
Consumers refused to pay more than the MRP. Dealers struggled to convince them by displaying the government’s orders. The new price list is available on the website www.tsbcl.telangana.gov.in/ts/
 
Liquor prices were last increased in  the state in May 2020. The orders stated that, “Strict action shall be initiated against dealers violating the MRP. Any such instance may be reported on toll free number 18004252523

"Hyderabad: Legislators from Telangana State are the highest-paid compared to their counterparts from all other states, including by way of salaries and allowances.
While a Telangana MLA takes home a cool Rs 2.50 lakh every month, an MLA from Tripura draws a measly Rs 17,500. A legislator from Delhi commands the next highest at Rs 2.10 lakh while those from Andhra Pradesh draw a monthly salary of Rs 1.30 lakh.
 
Telangana MLAs shot to the top of the ladder in 2016 when the state government hiked their pay and allowances by an overwhelming 163 per cent in one go.
Apart from these, family members of an MLA are entitled for a host of other benefits. Each legislator gets an accommodation allowance of Rs 25,000 per month if he does not stay in MLAs hostel. Accommodation, and water and electricity supplies are free in MLA quarters.
They enjoy massive concessions and benefits when they travel by trains or TSRTC buses.  MLAs are eligible for a car advance of Rs 30 lakh or the actual cost of the vehicle, whichever is less, in each term.
MLAs and their family members are entitled to free accommodation and treatment in any hospital maintained by the state government.  Hospitalisation and treatment charges incurred by them, including abroad, are duly reimbursed.
 
An MLA can appoint a personal assistant on deputation from any one of 13 departments up to the cadre of senior assistant. The PA will draw salary from the parent department.
Legislators from the state also draw substantial amounts as monthly pension up to a maximum of Rs 70,000.
The spouse of a deceased MLA, who is not married, will be entitled to receive the same amount of the pension, which the MLA would have been entitled to if alive.
However, there are conflicting arguments on whether MLAs deserve such high salaries and allowances. They have also drawn all-round ridicule from certain quarters.
 
""Contrary to general perceptions not all MLAs are rich. Many from BC, SC, ST and minority categories are poor. Many former legislators approach the government and NGOs for financial support,"" pointed out R. Krishnaiah, former MLA.
""There should be a rationale. When MLAs in other states can work for less than Rs 20,000 per month, why should those from Telangana get Rs 2.50 lakh?"" asked M. Padmanabha Reddy, secretary of Forum for Good Governance.

"HYDERABAD: India could be in the middle of a silent but unfolding disaster in its farmlands and fruit gardens because of a steady decline in honey bee population across the country, which could lead to a severe setback to the country’s food production.
Agriculture scientists, entomologists, apiculture experts and pesticide industry managers, have called for urgent studies to understand the real situation on honey bee health and populations across the country.
 
Almost 80 per cent of all crops and most fruit-bearing trees require pollination.
Studies have shown that honey bees are responsible for up to 75 per cent of all pollination that keeps the crop production engine grinding in India, like elsewhere in the world. “Right now, it is a tragedy.
Something needs to be done before it turns into a catastrophe,” said P. Ravindra Kumar, director of apiculture technology centre at Prof Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University in Hyderabad, on the status of honey bees in the country. While there are no nation-wide concerted studies to understand the bee population distribution, anecdotal evidence shows that the numbers of beehives are falling.
 
“When I started the apiculture programme at NIRD (now the National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj) in 2004, I used to see several beehives. Today, I hardly see any,” Kumar told Deccan Chronicle.
This is the situation in an area of the city that is full of trees, flowering plants, and is the hub of agriculture training and teaching in the state. One of the biggest drivers of the fall in honey bee population, as also other pollinating insects, is the indiscriminate use of pesticides in the country, with factors like heat-induced stress from rising temperatures because of climate change and radiation from cell phone towers, particularly in urban areas, contributing to their decline.
 
According to Prof Parthib Basu, who leads the centre for agroecology & pollination studies at the University of Calcutta, “honey bees, the flagship pollinator species, are under tremendous physiological stress in agro-eco systems.”
Pesticides and other agrochemicals such as herbicides and weedicides are killing bees and other pollinators, especially in intensively farmed areas.
Also of great concern is the impact of manifestations of sub-lethal pesticide doses the bees and other pollinating insects are exposed to. “In such cases, the bees don’t die immediately but will drop off. There are behavioural aberrations, they lose their ability to smell, can no longer see properly, which affects their orientation for foraging and returning to their hives,” he said. In addition to bees, Prof Basu said that there are hundreds of other non-flagship pollinators.
 
“They are also under tremendous stress. Perhaps we are losing this diversity without anyone noticing it,” he said. “Our research,” he said “has shown that pollinators get killed along with pests. This essentially brings down productivity because you are letting go of pollinators.”
Declaring that there is no such thing as a safe pesticide, Prof Basu said when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced, they entered India in a big way about a decade ago. They were initially thought to be safe for friendly pollinator insects but now it is known that they are equally harmful. “There are published reports that have shown that even the so-called bio-pesticides also have tremendous adverse effects on bees, at least at the sub-lethal levels,” he said.
 
Even if bees are affected at sub-lethal levels, their fall in health eventually contributes to the collapse of their colonies.

"HYDERABAD: India and China could well emerge as the biggest hotspots for new zoonotic viral diseases — those that spread from wildlife to other mammals —and very likely to humans over the next few decades if human pressure on forests continues to increase, driving increasing human wildlife interactions, the State of the World’s Forests 2022 report has said.
The report comes just days after a similar prediction was made in a research paper published in the journal ‘Nature’ which too said climate change-driven changes could see over the next 50 years more than 15,000 new cases of mammals transmitting viruses to other mammals.
 
The study says that at least 10,000 virus species have the capacity to infect humans. These, at present, according to the study ‘Climate change increases cross-species viral transmission risk’, are circulating silently in wild mammals.
The study warns that climate and land use change will produce new opportunities for viral sharing among previously geographically-isolated species of wildlife, which will result in zoonotic spillover, diseases spreading from animals to humans.
The study says this risk will be highest in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, and could see a rise of such viral disease transmission by 4,000 times.
 
Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a renewed concern over spread of zoonotic diseases, and this concern was reflected in the ‘State of the World’s Forests’ report. It said human health is closely connected to animal health, and the shared environment.
It has become apparent, the report said, that addressing the ecosystem-health dimension through responsible land-use planning and greater involvement of the forest and wildlife sectors and natural-resource managers is important. It called for continuous monitoring and surveillance, data-sharing and evidence-based decision-making to contain the threat.

"MANNANUR: The three-day Saileswaram Jatara that began on April 15 in Amrabad Tiger Reserve passed off peacefully, but not without its share of controversies.
With political patronage increasing for the festival, and with pressure from the government to allow everyone who wants to visit the temple during the jatara, this year’s entry fee collection turned into a mess with sudden orders from Hyderabad that the entry fee be scrapped, two days into the festival. An amount of Rs 1,000 was proposed to be deducted for private four-wheelers, and lower amounts for two-wheelers and autorickshaws from this year. Finally, orders were issued to halve the entry fee on the last day of the festival.
 
According to officials, no vehicle can be allowed into a tiger reserve without an entry fee, as per the rules of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, which governs all goings on in the country’s tiger reserves. The amount collected was desperately needed for a post-jatara cleanup, food and payments to the large number of volunteers, an official said, adding: “There will be a few tons of trash that will need to be picked up.”
This year there is an additional challenge of disposing tonsured hair, as many pilgrims are tonsuring their heads. When barbers were enquired about their plans to dispose of the waste, forest department staff were informed that the hair will be thrown in the surrounding forest or in the ‘gundam’, the pool of water formed by a waterfall near the temple. The barbers were then directed to carry sacks and to stuff the tonsured hair in it to be transported out of the tiger reserve for disposal.
 
Though entry into the forest area was originally planned to have been stopped at 6 p.m., this turned out to be impossible to implement as hundreds of vehicles began piling up near the entry point at Farhabad. The entire area, including the parking lots, the way to the temple and the location where shops and ‘anna dana satrams’ came up, was lit up with generators brought to the area.
A senior forest department official in Hyderabad said that a thorough review would be held sometime later this month to evaluate how to regulate the number of people entering forests for such events, and security measures inside Telangana’s wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves.

"What do we know about “stealth omicron” so far?
It’s an extra-contagious version of the omicron variant, but it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease.
 
Since it was first identified in November, BA.2 has been spreading around the globe, driving new surges in parts of Asia and Europe. It’s now the dominant coronavirus version in the U.S. and more than five dozen other countries.
It was given the “stealth” nickname because it looks like the earlier delta variant on certain PCR tests, says Kristen Coleman at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. The original omicron, by contrast, is easy to differentiate from delta because of a genetic quirk.
In rare cases, early research indicates BA.2 can infect people even if they’ve already had an omicron infection. COVID-19 vaccines appear just as effective against both kinds of omicron, offering strong protection against severe illness and death.
 
Health officials also are tracking other variants including XE — a combination of BA.2 and BA.1, the original omicron — that was first identified in January in the United Kingdom. The World Health Organization is keeping tabs on XE but has not yet deemed it a variant of concern or interest.

"Hyderabad: The famous King Koti palace, where the last Nizam stayed, on Monday turned into a war zone with scores of people, allegedly acting on behalf of jeweller Sukesh Gupta, an accused in several bank and land fraud cases, forcibly trying to gain entry into the palace and take its possession.
The Nazri Bagh Palace Trust, the custodian of the palace, had handed over the possession of the palace and issued delivery certificate to the Mumbai-based Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd on March 28 after the company completed the sale transaction. The company also got the registered sale deed released in its favour by clearing all the stamp duty arrears.
 
According to police, about 140 persons, some of them even carrying swords and lathis, tried to enter the palace and break open the gate using an earthmover. The city police acted swiftly and took about 40 people into custody while the others fled.
Assistant commissioner of police K. Venkat Reddy said a case of trespassing was registered against people who tried to enter the palace and an inquiry is on.
The hectic activity was seen at Narayanguda police station where both parties claiming possession of the property were summoned by the police. Interestingly, the representative of Sukesh Gupta at one stage proposed that the police take control of the palace and keep it in their custody till the dispute is resolved.
 
Significantly, the Enforcement Directorate had registered a case against Sukesh Gupta on charges of money laundering and selling the palace using fraudulent documents and fake sale deeds. A case with similar allegations is also underway in National Company Law Tribunal.
Rajesh Agarwal of Neeharika Infrastructure told this correspondent that Sukesh Gupta and Biyani had initially entered into an agreement with the trust and his company later invested Rs 70 crore, cleared all the arrears including the pending amount to be paid to the Trust and took possession of 28,000 square yards.
 
Agarwal also alleged that Sukesh Gupta’s men who were acting as directors had forged board resolutions and sold the property to another company with backdated sale deed. “However, the trust after receiving the full sale consideration handed over the possession to us,” Agarwal said, adding “attempts were being made to project as if we were not in possession.”
Agrawal also alleged that a city ruling party MLA had been helping Sukesh Gupta and presence of a confidant of the MLA and his demand to the police to release his men gave credence to these allegations.
 
“I saw a mob first damaged the yellow gate of Nizam-ki-Devdi with a JCB and around 130 to 140 men, one or two of them armed with swords and the others with lathis, barged into the gate,” said Mazhar Khan an automobile shop owner who was passing by.
Later after the police arrived and bolted the gate from inside many of them fled while some who were trying were caught and held in the police van, he said.
Meanwhile, Neeharika Infrastructure moved a lunch motion in the Telangana High Court seeking a direction to the police to not interfere in the case as it was a civil dispute. The court will take up the case for hearing on Tuesday.

"Hyderabad: Grossly compromising on the interests of the state and failing in their duty to protect government land parcels, revenue and municipal authorities have given up their decades-long legal fight over a prime piece of land located in the twin cities, estimated to be worth over Rs 1,500 crore, by granting the final layout right on it to a cooperative housing society, Deccan Chronicle has learnt.
Following a “request” made by a senior state government official, through a recent memo 976/Assn.III(1)/2019, GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar sanctioned a layout for 32 acres in Survey No 327 paiki of Shaikpet village in favour of S.N. Mutually Aided Cooperative Housing Society (popularly known as Sakkubainagar).
 
The GHMC commissioner's sanction came after its standing counsel submitted in the Telangana High Court that “according to the Municipal Corporation, Sy No. 327/paiki does not exist.”
Documentary evidence available with Deccan Chronicle revealed that different government agencies had taken a consistent stand for decades that Survey No. 327 paiki was a non-existent and fictitious survey number and that the only survey number available in the records — 327 — was government land. This view had been upheld by the judiciary at different points.
 
Incidentally, several cases filed by the state government claiming ownership of the land are still pending in the Telangana High Court and a “status quo” order has been in vogue in relation to this land parcel.
Inquiries by DC revealed that the Junior Civil Judge of the City Civil Court found discrepancies in the records submitted by the SN Society in an injunction suit and categorically said the land belonged to the government. The society filed the first appeal before the Additional Chief Judge, who upheld the Junior Civil Judge’s order. The society filed a second appeal in the High Court, which is still pending.
 
In another case on the same land, the society obtained an order from a single judge of the High Court to not dispossess them from the land but the government filed a writ appeal before the bench challenging the single judge’s orders. That case is also pending.
Meanwhile, the Additional Advocate General recommended to the government to initiate a suit for declaration of title in favour of the government and Hyderabad district revenue authorities actively pursued the case. The senior official who lobbied for the layout sanction referred to High Court orders in his memo apparently to justify his action but conveniently ignored that the court had made an observation in the same order that the state government may follow due process — initiate a title suit for ownership —  to take possession.
 
Sources said the Hyderabad district authorities had succeeded in getting the state government to issue orders entrusting the title suitcase to the Advocate General, who had prepared a draft plaint and sent it to the Hyderabad district collector who, in turn, sent it to the Special Chief Secretary, Revenue, for his approval.
Several reminders were sent to Special CS, Revenue, in the last two years, to approve the AG’s plea and pursue the case further in the High Court. Yet, the recommendation for sanctioning the layout was sent to the GHMC.
 
What is intriguing is that one D. K. Narayana Rao, a retired Osmania University employee, applied to obtain for information pertaining to the layout under the Right to Information Act (RTI) but the GHMC information officers categorically asserted in their reply that “it was a 20-year-old record and was not found in the available layout records.”
Within days of the officials saying had no records of the land parcel, the GHMC commissioner cleared the same file in favour of SN Society.
“When Hyderabad district authorities came to know that the society had applied for layout clearance, the collector wrote to the GHMC to not sanction any layout as the state government was fighting for the prime property,” sources said, adding that this correspondence too was ignored and layout approval given to the society.

"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao's dream project, the renovation of Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy temple in Yadadri, 70 km away from the city, has turned a visual treat on Saturday with every corner of the main temple hall being illuminated with colourful lights. While the 52 golden Kalasams on top of the gopurams add to the glory of the shrine, the new temple also has eye-catching chandeliers and special lighting.
The Chief Minister will inaugurate the renovated temple complex on Monday. With a blend of Pallava, Chalukya, Dravidian and Kakatiya styles of architecture, the temple features four mini temples and 12 wonderfully carved pillars which are the main attraction in the spacious hall measuring around 54 feet length and 36 feet in width.
 
The pillars, with sculptures of Alvars or poet-saints, are designed to enhance the aesthetic charm along the devotees’ queue line.
Eleven chandeliers - seven of them massive and four smaller – add to the exuberance of spiritual experience inside the new temple. Also, the main hall has been engineered in such a way that there is natural light and ventilation.  
An exclusive queue complex is being built, and it is in the final stages. The complex has four floors, each of which consists of two waiting halls. At any point, around 2,000 devotees can stand in the queue on each floor of the complex having a capacity of 8,000.
 
After darshan, devotees will be directed to a staircase across the hall that leads them outside the hall towards the Dwaja Stambha, through a massive 15-foot dwara.      
VIP darshan has a completely different route, with access to two separate elevators from across the lane along the presidential suites, and a passage to reach the main temple through massive dwara (doors) on the structure’s left hand side. On either side of the main hall, balconies with access to separate elevators have been built for the convenience of VIPs and pundits. The two elevators will lead to the rooms built underneath the structure.
 
However, it is said that changes could be made to regular devotees' entry and exit routes as per Vaastu recommendations, sources said. “There could be slight changes adhering to Vaastu, '' they said.
A 15-foot passage around the hall for Pradakshinas provides a serene experience to the devotees, with the comfort of seating halls after darshan. There is also a spacious Narasimha Swamy Kalyana Mandapa towards the right-hand side of the main hall.

"Hyderabad: Film director S.S. Rajamouli's long-awaited ‘RRR’ hit the screens on Friday to packed houses, the biggest release after two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. The initial turnout seemed to quell fears on the direction the film industry would take in the post-pandemic era.
The film has secured special permission from the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments to hike ticket prices. In the black market, reports said, tickets went for Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 a piece for the 7 am show — permission has been given for five shows a day — at main theatres at RTC crossroads.
 
Pratusha, Srivalli, Deepu (names changed), a group of friends, took a day off from office for a college friends' reunion and watched 'RRR' at Prasad I-Max. To their surprise, they were able to meet some crew members of the movie.
At single-screen theatres, the scenes were riotous with fans garlanding cutouts of their favourite actors, showering flower petals and firing crackers.
V.L. Sridhar, of VLS Sridavi Theatre, Chilkalguda, said, all shows had been booked solid till Monday. The higher ticket prices had made producers, exhibitor and distributors.
 
Yellina Jitendra Rambabu, a cinema analyst, said, “The opening collections and the fanfare as a whole reassure that the industry has a positive future.”
Producer Vishnu Induri, who has bankrolled films like N.T. Rama Rao’s biopic, ‘Jayalalithaa’, ‘83’, said the film industry was badly hit by the pandemic and films like ‘RRR’ would bring back hope and prompt filmmakers to continue to think big.
""It gives impetus for filmmakers' to make more pan-India films, narrate patriotic stories and initiate multi-starrers. It’s a fantastic and healthy trend,"" said Vishnu.
 
The performance of low-budget films like ‘The Kashmir Files’, which has raked in more than Rs 200 crore so far despite low expectations, is very difficult to comprehend, he said.
For producer-distributor Abhishek Nama, things boiled down to content. He said films like ‘RRR’ will attract the audience to theatres for the cinematic experience but content was important.
“What's heartening is that people are coming to cinema theatres post the pandemic. That's the need of the hour,"" elucidates Abhishek
 
While producers have recovered the film’s budget thanks to distribution, satellite and digital sales touching Rs 600 crore, it will be a challenge for distributors and exhibitors to earn the money back from ticket sales.
Director Mahi, who made ‘Yatra’ the biopic on YS Raja Sekhar Reddy, said that the trade business post the Covid era will be multi-layered. Film-makers may make films that are dedicated to either theatrical releases or OTTs.
Interestingly, producer Suresh Babu said it was too early to predict the pattern of audiences flocking theatres. He felt there was some unhappiness with the higher ticket prices.
 
“It’s premature to comment,” Suresh Babu told Deccan Chronicle. “Films like RRR are very rare, and hence people would love to watch it in theatres. But ‘The Kashmir Files’ has been the surprise package for me; it has caught the attention of the nation. Still, we need to wait and watch the theatrical scenario.""

"Hyderabad: A citizen who took IndiGo Airlines to consumer court after he missed a flight had to attend 15 hearings in the court here, but he won the case by a Rs 1 lakh compensation payment order.
Didugu Suresham and his daughter had missed their flight from Hyderabad to Kolkata as there was a delay in printing their boarding passes, though they had been allotted seats. As a result, they missed another connecting flight from Kolkata to Jorhat, Assam, as well.
 
There was only one flight to Jorhat from Kolkata, which they missed. Suresham's daughter had to report in Jorhat the next morning for admission into a college.
Suresham then had to book two more Indigo flights -- from Hyderabad to Kolkata and then one from Kolkata to Guwahati, after which they had to travel by bus overnight to reach Jorhat the next morning. 
Suresham registered a complaint with the airline, seeking an apology, action against the executive responsible at the airport and refund of the amount they spent for their flights. The airline rejected the pleas. He then lodged a case against the airline before the district consumer disputes redressal commission – I, Hyderabad in December, 2019.
 
Suresham had to attend 15 court hearings over two years because counsel for the airline kept seeking more time to present his papers. 
However, the complainant says he was not required to arrange for an advocate as the case was a Party in Person (PIP) filing, and also said the procedure was consumer- friendly.
The court ordered IndiGo to pay the petitioner Rs 1 lakh as compensation for the ‘hardship and mental agony’ he faced. It also asked IndiGo to refund the amount paid extra towards alternative travel tickets, as well as pay Rs 20,000 towards costs of litigation.

"New Delhi: Amid the buzz surrounding the film, Kashmir Files, the Kerala unit of Congress claimed in a tweet, now deleted, that more Muslims were killed in Jammu and Kashmir during 1990-2007 than Pandits, inviting the wrath of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which called the statements ""insane"".
'Kashmir Files' has brought the spotlight on the killings and forced exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits from the valley after the Pakistan sponsored terrorists ran amok there in the late 1980s and afterwards.
 
The deleted tweet of the Kerala unit of the Congress posted from its official Twitter handle attempted to project a statistical perspective to the issue of the killings and exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits, arguing that 15000 Muslims were killed during 1990-2007 against 399 Pandits.
The Kerala Congress in another tweet, part of a series, claimed that over one lakh Muslims were killed in the erstwhile state in the wake of the communal riots (1948) after the partition of the country while no Pandits were killed in retaliation.
The tweets were posted with '#KashmiriPandit issue'.
 
The BJP, reacting sharply, said that ""Congress doesn't understand history"". ""...this is the most insane statement that Congress can make. Congress doesn't understand history... and they've hugely distorted the version of history. Under the watch of Congress dispensations, over a lakh Pandits left the valley,"" said former Union Minister and senior BJP leader K J Alphons.
The Kerala Congress also sought to shift the onus for the exodus to the BJP, saying ""the migration suited the agenda of the BJP for the Hindu-Muslim division while carrying out the Ram Mandir issue in Ayodhya"". Another tweet claimed that the then Jammu and Kashmir Governor Jagmohan was an RSS man, and he in place of providing security to the Pandits asked them to leave the valley en masse.
 
""Pandits left the valley en masse under the direction of Governor Jagmohan who was an RSS man. The migration started under the BJP-supported VP Singh government,"" claimed the Kerala unit of Congress in another tweet, arguing further that the BJP supported VP Singh's government came to power in J&K in December 1989 and exodus began the very next month and BJP continued to support VP Singh till November 1990.

"The Telugu film Radhe Shyam starring Prabhas and Pooja Hegde, directed by Radha Krishna may have easily emerged as the highest opener in 2022 with a collection of Rs 72.41 crores across the country, but collections in the Hindi market were dented and hence the ‘pan India’ presence too took a beating.
Giving it tough competition is the film The Kashmir Files that has grown by 140% on the second day as compared to the collections of the first day.
 
Radhe Shyam’s opening day collections worldwide came to Rs 72.41, beating Bheemla Nayak and Valimai which stood at Rs 61.24 and Rs 59.28 respectively. But Radhe Shyam managed a Rs 48 crores all India collection.
Having said that, the Day one Collections in Hindi for Radhe Shyam stood at Rs 4.5 crores and collected Rs 5 crores on the second day totalling to Rs 9.5 crores in two days.
Pre-release business helps the film
While we steer away from the phenomenal Baahubali collections, let us tell you that the Prabhas starrer Saaho which was Prabhas’ next release after Baahubali: The Conclusion collected Rs 24.40 crores and the combined collections across all languages was Rs 140 crores.
 
“I will be surprised if this film collects a lot of money — will be happy if the producers recover their money,” Prabhas told us recently, clearly aware of the limitations of the romantic subject Radhe Shyam. The film has collected more than Rs 100 crore by the end of the second day.          
The pre-release business of Radhe Shyam was strong, where they reportedly cashed in more than Rs 200 crore from overseas, satellite and digital rights and sold the theatrical rights for over Rs 105 crore.  
 
Kashmir Files beats Prabhas
The Anupam Kher starrer The Kashmir Files which had managed a surprising Rs 3.55 crores on the first day registered a 140 % growth or more than double the collections on the second day and got Rs 8.50 crores ending up with Rs 12 crores in 2 days which is much more than the Radhe Shyam collections in India.
“The Kashmir Files has a lot more screens now and the film has had the highest ever growth for any film post covid era for the second day as compared to the first day. The film is growing by word of mouth,” informs Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh.
 
The Kashmir Files, directed by Agnihotri, narrates the plight of Kashmiri Pandits in the 90s. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi also met the team of The Kashmir Files and fiercely praised the film, many critics who have not appreciated the filmmaker’s right-wing leanings still went on to praise the film for not attempting to either whitewash the story or take sides.
The film was released first in 700 screens worldwide while Radhe Shyam released in more than 3000 screens.

"Mumbai: Actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu has an important message for the trollers who judge women by their outfits.
Samantha donned a beautiful deep neck gown to the Critics Choice Awards on March 10. Her photos and videos from the event went viral on social media on which a section of netizens trolled her for her choice of outfit.
 
Taking to her Instagram Story on Saturday, the actor slammed trollers who judged her by her outfit. She wrote a long note amid the backdrop of herself wearing the same outfit.
The note read, ""As a woman, I bear firsthand knowledge of what it means to be judged. We judged women based on what they wear, their race, education, social standing, appearance, skin tone and the list goes on and on. Making snap judgements about a person simply based on the clothes they wear is quite literally the easiest thing one can do.""
 
She further added, ""Now that we're in the year 2022-can we finally stop judging a woman based on the hemlines & necklines she adorns and focus on instead of bettering ourselves?""
""Turning that judgement inward and training it on ones own self is evolution! Projecting our ideals on someone else never did anyone any good...let's gently rewrite the way we measure and understand a person!"" she concluded with heart emoticons.
Talking about Samantha's upcoming projects, she is awaiting the release of her next film 'Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kaathal' alongside Vijay Sethupati and Nayanthara, which is slated for a theatrical release on April 28, 2022.
 
Apart from this, she also has the mythological film, 'Shakuntalam' in her kitty.

"Chennai: The pandemic induced apprehension, ingenuity and his flair for technological innovation, drove the 25-year-old Dinesh SP, project associate in IIT Madras, and his bride Janaganandhini Ramasamy, to host their wedding reception on Metaverse platform, earning the spontaneous appreciation of relatives, friends and gaining a world-wide audience.
The reception held at Sivalingapuram village of Anchetti taluk in Tamil Nadu's Krishnagiri district, shot the newly wedded couple to fame.
 
Dinesh, who is into Blockchain, NFTs and Crypto, says his is the first Metaverse marriage in Asia. ÂI got married in February 2022. I had planned to conduct my reception on Metaverse platform on February 6, due to the pandemic which had restricted the guests,Â he says.
Hogwarts theme from Harry Potter was the choice the couple made for their reception. A musical concert was held on Metaverse from Chennai and the event saw about 200 guests who attended the reception receive food at their homes.
ÂThe unique Metaverse marriage reception was the first to be held in Asia and it was an instant hit among the people,Â claims Vinesh Selvaraj, CEO of TardiVerse, the Sriperumbudur based Information Technology firm, which designed the virtual platform for Dinesh and Janaganandhini.
 
ÂIt took our 12-member team nearly a month from January 3 to complete the project,Â Vignesh told PTI. He says the Metaverse will be the 3.0 technology wielding tremendous influence on people.
The unique event had fetched Vignesh 60 orders from various parts of India and abroad and currently he is readying to host the Valentine's Day celebrations this February 14 on Metaverse platform in Chennai.
ÂLovers could exchange gifts on this platform,Â he adds.
A virtual world where people can interact, hold meetings, buy land, and do lot more, Metaverse, which has been around for a long time, has had huge success in science fiction movies.
 
The Matrix, the story of a computer programmer, and Sword Art Online, a popular anime series, flex this technology. Back home, in November last year, popular actor Kamal Haasan unveiled his plans of a new virtual avatar to become the first actor to enter the game-based Metaverse.
TardiVerse created the avatars of the guests, the bride and the groom besides that of bride's late father who passed away last April. ÂWe created a 3D avatar of his father-in-law as sought by Dinesh,Â says Vignesh who sees large scope for similar events in India and abroad.
 
The reception was held also with the support of CoinSwitch Kuber, a crypto exchange.

"Mumbai: While the whole nation has been mourning the demise of legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, netizens are reacting to a viral picture of superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his manager Pooja Dadlani, offering their last respect to the megastar.
A picture has been doing rounds on the internet where superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his manager Pooja Dadlani could be seen offering their last respects to the megastar whose last rites were conducted at Shivaji Park on Sunday in Mumbai with full state honours.
 
In the viral snap, Khan could be seen raising his hands in dua, while Dadlani could be seen folding her hands in order to pay homage to the celebrated singer. Khan also paid her a floral tribute and touched her feet after reciting the dua.
Fans, who were touched by his gesture, started hailing the snap as 'a picture of secular India'.
""Some Bigots can't even digest this beautiful sight of uniting India! Truly #LataMangeshkar ji was that human who United people alive and continued doing after passing away! @iamsrk #ShahRukhKhan is one of that breed Spreading love,"" a twitter user wrote.
 
""There's no one like #ShahRukhKhan. There won't ever be. Your hatred makes us love and respect him even more. Shame on you!,"" wrote another.
A third fan wrote, ""Proud to be a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. That's it that's a tweet.""
Another tweeted, ""Best example of secular India.""
The picture was indeed a 'positive picture' that went viral on social media on Sunday, but a section of people also criticized the 'Om Shanti Om' star for allegedly 'spitting' on the mortal remains of Lata Mangeshkar, after reciting his dua.
 
""Can't believe SRK spitted on #LataDidi's body while paying his ""last respect"" to her... Even if your Mazhab teaches you this, practice this at your home or with your own people..."" a Twitter user wrote.
A second user wrote, ""Shame on SRK who spitted on #LataDidi's body while paying his ""last respect"" to her.""
Meanwhile, many fans came countering the act as ""a religious practise after reciting dua (prayer).""
A user tweeted, ""@iamsrk reading a dua & blowing on #LataDidi 's mortal remains for protection & blessings in the next journey. It's a part of Prayer.""
 
""You aren't just a bigot but pure evil to twist a dua said in reverence of the departed soul to spread hatred. Think about it people, will we let the evil win? #LataMangeshkar #ShahRukhKhan,"" a second user wrote.
""Some people are filled with hatred that they are misconstruing an act of a genuine dua. Why can't they leave their Islamophobia for 1 sec atleast? Infact you all are spitting venom out there. So stop!! #ShahRukhKhan,"" a third user wrote.
Another wrote, ""Another Propaganda has been created!@iamsrk reading a dua & blowing on #LataDidi 's mortal remains for protection & blessings in the next journey. It's a part of Prayer. Can't comprehend the level of bitterness of those saying he is spitting. SHAME #ShahRukhKhan #LataMangeshkar""
 
For the unversed, this was the first time SRK made a public appearance after keeping away from the public eye since late last year following the arrest of his son Aryan Khan in a drug case.
Meanwhile, speaking of the Bharat Ratna awardee who passed away at the age of 92, Lata Mangeshkar was cremated at Shivaji Park on Sunday in Mumbai with full state honours.
The vehicle in which her body was taken to the stadium was completely decorated with white flowers and also had a massive photo of hers. The coffin in which her mortal remains were placed was also wrapped in tricolour as the army marched along. For the final rites, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to pay his last respects.
Several celebrities were present at the funeral including actor Shah Rukh Khan, actor Ranbir Kapoor, actor Aamir Khan, actor Shraddha Kapoor, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, singer Anuradha Podwal, musician Shankar Mahadevan, actor Vidya Balan and her husband and producer Siddharth Roy Kapur. They paid floral tributes to the late iconic singer.
 
Prominent ministers including Uddhav Thackeray, Raj Thackeray, Aaditya Thackeray, Piyush Goyal and Sharad Pawar were also present.
Eight priests dressed in white arrived to conduct the final rites. Blocks of sandalwood were placed at her body while the priests chanted the mantras.
Late Lata Mangeshkar's brother Hridaynath accompanied by his son Aadinath Mangeshkar lit the funeral pyre. She also received a gun salute during the last rites.
She was admitted to Mumbai's Breach Candy hospital on January 8 after she was diagnosed with COVID-19 and pneumonia.
 
Two-day national mourning will be observed in memory of Lata Mangeshkar, government sources informed on Sunday.

"New Delhi: When Kapil Dev lifted the World Cup at the Lord's balcony, the erstwhile BCCI president and one of the powerful ministers in the Indira Gandhi cabinet, late NKP Salve had a different worry.
It was still some years to go for economic liberalization and an astute businessman like Jagmohan Dalmiya's foresight to turn cricket into an industry.
 
Kapil's Devils needed to be celebrated but the BCCI, which currently is looking at USD 5 billion television contract, barely paid its cricketers a daily allowance of 20 pounds.
Salve had to turn to his 'Man Friday' and Indian cricket's 'one stop Encyclopedia' Raj Singh Dungarpur for a solution to be able to reward the players for such an achievement.
'Raj bhai', as Dungarpur was known in Indian cricket circle, decided that the only way was to request his close friend and one of country's biggest cricket fans Lata Mangeshkar to do a pro-bono concert in the national capital's Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium.
 
The IG was packed to capacity as 'Lata ji' did a near two hour programme.
The event ensured that BCCI collected enough money and each of the 14 members got Rs 1 lakh each as cash award.
""It was a very decent sum in those days. We would otherwise save up tour money and daily allowance for that month and it came to barely Rs 60,000,"" Sunil Valson recollected while speaking to PTI.
""I remember some people said we will give you Rs 5000, some said Rs 10,000 and it was very disrespectful at times. But then Lata ji sang in that concert. What a function it was and one of the most memorable evenings to watch her sing live,"" Valson said.
 
The BCCI and more so Dungarpur never forgot how 'Lata ji' saved Indian cricket from sheer embarrassment just because of her pristine love for the 'Gentleman's game'.
As a mark of respect, the BCCI till her death kept two complimentary VIP tickets allocated at any Indian stadium for her, where India played an international match.
""Just like we have quota for each match (before COVID era) for sponsors, state associations, there are two tickets at every cricket match for Lata ji,"" a senior BCCI official informed.
 
The Indian cricketers wore a black armband and also observed two minutes silence as a mark of respect for the departed soul.
The Mangeshkars were really cricket fans but one of the finest chroniclers of Mumbai cricket, senior journalist Makarand Waingankar recalls the days in 60s when Lata Mangeshkar was a regular visitor at the CCI Stadium and later at the Wankhede Stadium in 70s and 80s.
""Lata ji and her brother music composer Hridaynath Mangeshkar were regulars at Test matches held at Brabourne Stadium. Later through the 70s she would hardly miss any game even with such busy recording schedule,"" Waingankar, who was a young journalist back then, recalled.
 
Mangeshkar would sit alongside Dungarpur and former Mumbai legend and Test opener Madhav Apte and watch the proceedings.
There is an old video of Mangeshkar also watching an India versus West Indies Test match in Chennai, where she must have gone for a recording back in 70s.
She was very close to all Mumbai cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar and Sachin Tendulkar, who spoke about her with unmatchable humility and mother like respect.
She would often drop in at the Cricket Club of India and enjoy cricketing discussion in the company of Dungarpur and another distinguished Test cricketer Hanumant Singh, who was the former's nephew.
 
Tendulkar would often say that she saw ""Maa Saraswati"" in Mangeshkar.
It's so poignant that the 'Nightingale of India' left a day after Saraswati Puja.

"The box office collections of Allu Arjun–Rashmika Mandanna-starrer Pushpa The Rise have been phenomenal, with even the dubbed versions, including Hindi, setting the cash registers ringing. In fact, the Sukumar-directorial recently went past the Rs 100-crore club in Hindi — an incredible feat considering the pandemic and prevailing movie theatre situation.
Even as we applaud Allu Arjun and Sukumar for their work, we turn the spotlight on some other interesting aspects and people instrumental in making the film a blockbuster.
 
The backstory to Thaggede le
Thaggede le (no stepping back) — Pushpa’s signature phrase from the film has become a rage. From actors to international cricketers’ celebs have been emulating this dialogue accompanied with the signature gesture.
However, the film’s director Sukumar revealed that the gesture wasn’t something he had planned consciously.
“We were keen to have a signature gesture for the protagonist — a gesture that he had to repeatedly do to emphasise his attitude. But we hadn’t figured any. While shooting an action sequence, I observed Allu Arjun unconsciously making this gesturing repeatedly in between the shots. I thought it was an apt one and both of us fixed it as the signature gesture,” explains Sukumar.
 
However, Sukumar further points out, they added the phrase thaggede le to the gesture to make it even more telling. “We wanted both the phrase and the gesture to be in sync with the hero’s attitude and thought thaggede le aptly mirrored the hero’s attitude and conduct,” states Sukumar.
Of course, the filmmaker hadn’t ever expected that the signature phrase and gesture would become a sensation. “But as both of it added to the hero’s attitude, it flowed naturally, without looking like a forced inclusion. It’s probably why it worked big time,” adds Sukumar.
 
The swashbuckling move over a number
The ‘instant chartbuster’ numbers for the entire film was courtesy composer Devi Sri Prasad (DSP). But the most daring move by DSP was choosing Indravathi Chauhan for the number Oo Antava… Oo Oo Antava… essentially because Indravathi had never before sung professionally. She’s a folk singer who rendered her songs at a few stage shows.
But DSP had wanted to bring out local talent and so he reached out to her and recorded the special number. Turns out the song, which talks about male gaze, tops YouTube’s ‘Top 100 Music Videos Global’ list. An incredible feat indeed, considering that the song was sung by a newcomer!
Indravathi shares her surprise too.
 
“When singers go in to record a number, composers only sometimes reveal which film they’re recording the song for,” she says, adding that she was surprised to know that she was called on to record a number.
“DSP garu had seen some of my stage performances, and was surprised to know that I was singer Mangli’s youngster sister. When he asked me to sing the Oo Antava... Oo Oo Antava number, I confessed to him that I couldn’t pull it off because I didn’t think I had a voice that suited the song.”
 
But thankfully DSP persisted, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Indravathi describes the experience of singing the song as ‘different and interesting’ but admits she’s shocked though happy over how big a hit the number became.
“It was unbelievable because I’d never rendered a song in that genre, and I thought it was impossible, but all the credit goes to DSP sir,” says Indravathi with a smile. She’s now been getting several other offers too.
Mangli had crooned the Kannada version of the same song her sister sang in Telugu. Just as in Telugu, the Kannada song went on to become a rage.
 
“It actually surprised me that DSP sir made me sing the Kannada version instead of the Telugu version,” expresses Mangli. “Perhaps he wanted to introduce new folk talent in Telugu, which was why he launched Indravathi.”
That being said, she’s not missed the fact that it’s very rare that two sisters would get to sing the same song in two different languages. “But I am blessed for the response I got for the song,” she explains.
Of course, there’s now pressure on the sister-duo to come up with more super-hit numbers. “I wouldn’t want to call it pressure, but yes there’s definitely more responsibility on us,” shares Mangli.
 
Lyrics & Music
DSP’s pulsating music in the film was ably complemented by Chandrabose’s insightful lyrics that give the right dose of heroism and a glimpse into the story of Pushpa. Be it the vivacious Srivalli, the foot-tapping Saami Saami, the vibrant Daakko Daakko Meka or the mesmerising Oo Antava...Oo Oo Antava, all numbers have been hailed for its lyrics.
Interestingly, lyrics for all the songs in the film were themed around the protagonist’s ideology, going a long way in becoming integral to his characterisation in the film. Chandrabose, who’s written award-winning lyrics for over two decades, says it’s always a great opportunity writing lyrics for rare stories and songs.
 
Stating that it’s always a pleasure working with director Sukumar, he adds, “I always try to blend lyrics with emotion. The lyrics to all the songs were inspired by the philosophies and lessons in real-life situations that are touched upon in the film. Hence, the objective was to portray the rise of the protagonist in sync to what’s happening in real life too.”
However, the lyricist smiles, reminiscing how his journey as lyricist was made even more challenging with Sukumar. “As the songs drove the narrative, the lyrics had to always describe the situation and the journey of the characters. That’s exactly what we did with Puspha. DSP, Sukumar and I’d sit discussing it all for hours, after which the songs and lyrics would come alive,” Chandrabose reveals.
 
A lot of DSP’s songs grow on one’s ears with time though the numbers from Pushpa: The Rise, which were pivotal in making the film a super success, became instant super-hits.
But the best part for the composer about working with director Sukumar was that they tried to bring out something new from every technician. “I try to find song inspiration from daily life incidents, which also pushes me to be creative and come up with interesting tunes,” he says. “In fact, most of the songs in Pushpa reflect the contemporary mind sets of people.”

"Hyderabad: A number of teachers, who faced financial crisis during the two Covid-19 lockdowns, took to cultivation of ganja to make ends meet and earn an extra buck. Intelligence officials, who obtained leads regarding rampant drug peddling, have allegedly submitted their comprehensive report to the government that led a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on dealing with menace.
Sources said that teachers working in both government and private institutions opted to cultivate ganja in their houses, fields and other public places.
 
“Most of the ganja is coming from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and transported to different places via Hyderabad. Only ten per cent of ganja was seized by the law enforcement agencies. The offenders have chosen new routes to supply the material to kingpins, who, in turn, smuggle and supply the material to their customers,” sources said.
The banned substances being brought into the states, mostly by Nigerians, include heroin, cocaine, ephedrine, charas, hashish and MDMA. “Addicts, including school, college students, have become peddlers, which has widened the supply chain,” sources said, adding that lack of coordination within the law enforcement agencies is one of the reasons for the increase in supply.

"Vijayawada: The ancient Haridasulu community too is shedding traditions and turning modern in this digital era, adopting QR codes for alms and using mopeds fitted with audio players to wander around streets to collect alms during the Sankranti festival season.
The community is gradually disappearing from the mainstream society due to swift social changes. Fewer in numbers, the modern Haridasulu have printed QR codes on their tamburas and collecting alms from people this year.
 
The Haridasulu have been a prominent presence in public space during the three-day harvest festival, Sankranti. The new generation of them is reluctant to practise their traditional roles. The Haridasulu with akshayapatra (utensil to collect alms) set on head, musical instrument tambura on the right shoulder and chitadalu (castanets/cymbals) on the left hand, used to chant Rama keertans and visit every house to collect alms during the festival.
Their number began dwindling in the streets in recent years of Sankranti festival. This time, too, only a few Haridasulu were seen around. The tradition itself is dying down.
 
Interestingly, Haridasulu are no more walking through the streets; they are moving around on mopeds. They do not chant the keertans anymore. Instead, they play the recorded sankeertans through mini audio players and via the speakers fitted to the mopeds.
Also, the placement of akshayapatra changed from head to the stand of the moped. People are putting alms (cash) on the bike/moped akshyapatras and paying through UPIs by scanning the QR codes.
A Haridasu, A. Visawandham, said that some people are facing difficulty to give alms in currency due to the problem of shortage of coins. Hence, Haridasulu are using QR codes to collect alms. Haridasulu started wandering through streets a month before Sankranti, chanting the sankeertans, in the past. But, the new generation is reluctant to practise this tradition.
 
Viswanadham said that children in their families used to learn sundarakanda and Bhagavatam and chant them as also other keertans, but the present generation lacked the initiation. This is also a reason for the gradual disappearance of the Haridasu tradition during Sankranti.
The Dasari community and its sub-castes form into Haridasulu. Since these groups have reservation facility, the younger generation is giving preference to education and taking up various low-level government jobs and also getting employed in the private sector.
Senior priest Gopal Sastry noted that people enjoyed a life of prosperity during the Kingdom of Lord Rama. There was no one to receive alms. Noticing this, the Lord created Haridasulu, a community to practise the profession of chanting keertans to receive alms.
 
Haridasulu are gradually disappearing. This year, the streets saw only a handful of Haridasulu.

"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad is all set to become a candidate host city for Formula E world championship, a race for electric cars.
The city will join the elite club of New York, London, Berlin, Rome and Seoul which have already been hosting the event, thanks to the initiative of industries and IT minister K. T. Rama Rao. The Federation of Internationale de Automobile holds the annual racing event for the most environmental-friendly cars.
 
A tripartite agreement will be signed by the state government, Formula E Association and Greenko, a leading alternative energy provider, on Monday “to make Hyderabad a candidate host city for Formula E race on yearly basis.”
Sources told this newspaper that Anand Mahindra, whose team is already a participant in the race, took initiative to bring India into the Formula E circuit and suggested metros like New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru besides Hyderabad. “After making field visits to all cities, the Formula E representatives in India narrowed down on Hyderabad and gave in principle approval,” sources said.
 
The best part of Formula E is that there would be no need to build a separate track unlike F1 and the racing would be done on existing city roads.
The team had visited the Hussainsagar circuit of Tank Bund and Necklace road, the circular road around KBR Park in Jubilee Hills and financial district road in Gachibowli. “A final decision may be made on Monday,” sources added.
The state government will play the facilitator role and the prime responsibility of it would be improving the infrastructure. “We may have to widen the roads wherever they suggest,” sources said, adding that building stands for spectators all along the track and providing other logistics would fall in government scope.
 
Formula E, which had its first race in 2014, is currently into its eighth season. It will start this month end in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, and the circuit covers cities like Mexico, Rome, Vancouver, New York and London.

"KABUL:  In a Kabul neighborhood, a gaggle of boys kick a yellow ball around a dusty playground, their boisterous cries echoing off the surrounding apartment buildings.
Dressed in sweaters and jeans or the traditional Afghan male clothing of baggy pants and long shirt, none stand out as they jostle to score a goal. But unbeknown to them, one is different from the others.
 
At not quite 8 years old, Sanam is a bacha posh: a girl living as a boy. One day a few months ago, the girl with rosy cheeks and an impish smile had her dark hair cut short, donned boys’ clothes and took on a boy’s name, Omid. The move opened up a boy’s world: playing soccer and cricket with boys, wrestling with the neighborhood butcher’s son, working to help the family make ends meet.
In Afghanistan’s heavily patriarchal, male-dominated society, where women and girls are usually relegated to the home, bacha posh, Dari for “dressed as a boy,” is the one tradition allowing girls access to the freer male world.
 
Under the practice, a girl dresses, behaves and is treated as a boy, with all the freedoms and obligations that entails. The child can play sports, attend a madrassa, or religious school, and, sometimes crucially for the family, work. But there is a time limit: Once a bacha posh reaches puberty, she is expected to revert to traditional girls’ gender roles. The transition is not always easy.
It is unclear how the practice is viewed by Afghanistan’s new rulers, the Taliban, who seized power in mid-August and have made no public statements on the issue.
 
Their rule so far has been less draconian than the last time they were in power in the 1990s, but women’s freedoms have still been severely curtailed. Thousands of women have been barred from working, and girls beyond primary school age have not been able to return to public schools in most places.
With a crackdown on women’s rights, the bacha posh tradition could become even more attractive for some families. And as the practice is temporary, with the children eventually reverting to female roles, the Taliban might not deal with the issue at all, said Thomas Barfield, a professor of anthropology at Boston University who has written several books on Afghanistan.
 
“Because it’s inside the family and because it’s not a permanent status, the Taliban may stay out (of it),” Barfield said.
It is unclear where the practice originated or how old it is, and it is impossible to know how widespread it might be. A somewhat similar tradition exists in Albania, another deeply patriarchal society, although it is limited to adults. Under Albania’s “sworn virgin” tradition, a woman would take an oath of celibacy and declare herself a man, after which she could inherit property, work and sit on a village council - all of which would have been out of bounds for a woman.
 
In Afghanistan, the bacha posh tradition is “one of the most under-investigated” topics in terms of gender issues, said Barfield, who spent about two years in the 1970s living with an Afghan nomad family that included a bacha posh. “Precisely because the girls revert back to the female role, they marry, it kind of disappears.”
Girls chosen as bacha posh usually are the more boisterous, self-assured daughters. “The role fits so well that sometimes even outside the family, people are not aware that it exists,” he said.
 
“It’s almost so invisible that it’s one of the few gender issues that doesn’t show up as a political or social question,” Barfield noted.
The reasons parents might want a bacha posh vary. With sons traditionally valued more than daughters, the practice usually occurs in families without a boy. Some consider it a status symbol, and some believe it will bring good luck for the next child to be born a boy.
But for others, like Sanam’s family, the choice was one of necessity. Last year, with Afghanistan’s economy collapsing, construction work dried up. Sanam’s father, already suffering from a back injury, lost his job as a plumber. He turned to selling coronavirus masks on the streets, making the equivalent of $1-$2 per day. But he needed a helper.
 
The family has four daughters and one son, but their 11-year-old boy doesn’t have full use of his hands following an injury. So the parents said they decided to make Sanam a bacha posh.
“We had to do this because of poverty,” said Sanam’s mother, Fahima. “We don’t have a son to work for us, and her father doesn’t have anyone to help him. So I will consider her my son until she becomes a teenager.”
Still, Fahima refers to Sanam as “my daughter.” In their native Dari language, the pronouns are not an issue since one pronoun is used for “he” and “she.”
 
Sanam says she prefers living as a boy.
“It’s better to be a boy...I wear (Afghan male clothes), jeans and jackets, and go with my father and work,” she said. She likes playing in the park with her brother’s friends and playing cricket and soccer.
Once she grows up, Sanam said, she wants to be either a doctor, a commander or a soldier, or work with her father. And she’ll go back to being a girl.
“When I grow up, I will let my hair grow and will wear girl’s clothes,” she said.
The transition isn’t always easy.
 
“When I put on girls’ clothes, I thought I was in prison,” said Najieh, who grew up as a bacha posh, although she would attend school as a girl. One of seven sisters, her boy’s name was Assadollah.
Now 34, married and with four children of her own, she weeps for the freedom of the male world she has lost.
“In Afghanistan, boys are more valuable,” she said. “There is no oppression for them, and no limits. But being a girl is different. She gets forced to get married at a young age.”
Young women can’t leave the house or allow strangers to see their face, Najieh said. And after the Taliban takeover, she lost her job as a schoolteacher because she had been teaching boys.
 
“Being a man is better than being a woman,” she said, wiping tears from her eye. “It is very hard for me. ... If I were a man, I could be a teacher in a school.”
“I wish I could be a man, not a woman. To stop this suffering.”

"A four-day work week might soon become a reality for the working class in India. This will be possible as the Central Government is likely to implement the four new labour codes by the next fiscal year. The four new codes are on wages, social security, industrial relations and occupation safety, health and working conditions.
A senior government official has been quoted by PTI saying, ""The four labour codes are likely to be implemented in the next financial year of 2022-23 as a large number of states have finalised draft rules on these. The Centre has completed the process of finalising the draft rules on these codes in February 2021. But since labour is a concurrent subject, the Centre wants the states to implement these as well in one go.""
 
With the implementation of the new codes there will be a change in a number of aspects relating to work culture and employment in the country. These changes will have a significant impact on working hours, take-home salary and PF contribution.
Reportedly, once the new codes have been implemented, there would be a reduction in the take-home salary of the employees as there would be a provident fund contributing. It is also likely that with the implementation of the four-day work week, the employees will have to work for 12 hours a day for these 4 days, since the labour ministry has made it clear that the requirement of a 48-hour weekly work is compulsory.
 
This news also came days after the United Arab Emirates became the first country across the globe to implement a four and a half-day working week for all government employees.
More about the new Labour Codes -
At Least 13 states have pre-published draft rules on these laws. According to PTI, the Centre has already finalised the rules under these codes and now states are required to frame regulations on their part as labour is a concurrent subject.
The central government is pursuing with the remaining state governments to frame the rules under all four Codes, according to the senior government officer.
 
As per Union Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav's reply in Rajya Sabha, draft rules have been pre-published by 24 states on The Code on Wages.
These states are Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Goa, Mizoram, Telangana, Assam, Manipur, UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and GNCT of Delhi.
Similarly, the 20 states which have pre-published draft rules on The Industrial Relations Code are Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Manipur, Assam, Goa, UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry.
 
As many as 18 states have pre-published draft rules on The Code on Social Security. These states are Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Assam, Gujarat, Goa and UT of Jammu and Kashmir.
As many as 13 states have pre-published draft rules on The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code.

"HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will act sternly and slap fines up to the tune of Rs 50, 000 against all dog lovers who have not registered their pets.
In the initial phase, mandatory registration applies only to dogs while other pets stand exempted.
 
Officials informed that pet owners will soon face the heat if they carry unregistered pets out in the open. Civic authorities claimed that considering the threat perception to public safety if one carries unregistered pets in parks, on the streets and other open places, they are levying hefty fines ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000, depending on the violation, apart from taking possession of the animals. The owners can get back their pets only after the penalty is paid. This move will make dog owners more accountable and responsible, say officials.
 
As per official data, there are around 50,000 pet dogs in the city, only 465 of them are registered. Registration of pets not only ensures safety but it also regulates how it interacts with the society and vice-versa, they maintained.
As per norms, it is mandatory for dog owners to obtain a license and must produce proof that the animal has been given anti-rabies vaccination and renew it every year.
The official said that they have seen several cases where the owners just abandon their pets by the roadside when they develop diseases or other health problems. He said that the pets have to be vaccinated and neutered and microchips should be installed before getting the license. With the microchip, the GHMC will keep a check on the number of pets in the city and track the owners, who have abandoned them.
 
“The owners have to be responsible towards their pets. Our veterinary wing will make random inspections. If any owner is found guilty, the pets will be seized and they would be freed on payment of the fine amount,” he added.
The official said after holding a license, no apartment or association can object over having pets and there will be a license fee remission for Indie dogs to promote their adoption.
Unlike the manual registration, pet owners can logon to www.ghmc.gov.in and click on the ‘Our services’ section, choose the option to fill an application for a license and enter the details. Subsequently, they have to pay Rs 50 for getting the license.
 
A unique identification will be provided to the dog after registration
and pet owners should submit their dog’s recent vaccination certificate, any proof of residence and a no-objection certificate from their neighbours.
The application will be automatically forwarded to the veterinary assistant director or deputy director. On verification by the office, a license will be issued.

"Samantha’s first special number, Oo Antava OoOo Antava, in the upcoming film PushpaThe Rise has been the talking point ever since it was released a few days ago. The actress’ seductive look and sensuous moves haven’t gone down well with many, who feel that the lyrics are not suited to her personality, especially in light of her strong performance in Family Man.
Her dramatic movements, expressions and gestures in the massy song aren’t in sync with how the audience sees Samantha. Also, the lyrics are about how men generally look at women, and her skimpy outfits and the bling sets add to the effect.
 
Netizens have been trolling Samantha, bringing up an old tweet by her in which she describes as ‘regressive’ a poster showing Kriti Sanon falling at the feet of Mahesh Babu in the film 1 – Nenokkadine. Now that she herself has featured in a dance number that has arguably regressive lyrics, netizens are calling her a ‘hypocrite’.

"New Delhi: There is no better feeling for parents to see their children growing up and working hard for their dreams. Music maestro A.R. Rahman could easily relate to this as his daughters Raheema Rahman and Khatija Rahman are proudly following his legacy.
Both Raheema and Khatija are musicians. They have even performed along with their father during the U2 concert in Mumbai in 2019. The two young girls also enjoy a huge fan following on social media. Khatija's latest song 'Rock A Bye Baby' from the Netflix film 'Mimi' was appreciated by many.
 
Speaking about his talented daughters, A.R. Rahman told ANI, ""They (Raheema and Khatija) have the toughest mindsets. Anything they do, they feel like they have to be good enough...all these things come to their mind. So I keep telling them not to be worried about anything, just do it, just do the stuff and then you will have your own personality...God will bless you and nobody is going to compare them.""
Not only his daughters but A.R Rahman has also been guiding many other young talents for a while now -- especially through his institution KM Music Conservatory and BAFTA Breakthrough India Initiative, which identifies, celebrates and supports talents working in films, games, or TV.
 
According to him, it's his duty to give back something valuable to the society.
""It's the natural human tendency...when you are growing up, you go to a well and you take water from it and when you actually become a grown-up, you realise that it's your time to create a well so that the next generation can pick up water from there...through that you get more happiness. I always feel what you give is yours and what you take is not yours,"" the Oscar-winner emphasised.
Also, working with new talents has somehow enhanced A.R. Rahman's personality.
 
""When I was young I have worked with a lot of older people. I was 12-13 when I went to the studio for the first time and saw people beyond my 30s, 50s, 60s and 70s...I was the youngest person and what I learned from them is commitment, professionalism and art.

"Famous Hollywood celebrities like Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus identify themselves as gender fluid. But when Ayushmann Khurana shared his post, comments poured in from across the globe, ridiculing him for the careless usage of the phrase “gender fluid”. He also infuriated the LGBTQ+ community and allies. Many followers made it their mission to educate the actor on the right usage of the word. Others suggested alternative phrases the actor could’ve used to convey his point.
“You’re a cis het male, not gender fluid. Wearing a black nail paint and starring in a movie based on gay men, isn’t gender fluid. Do better [sic],”  a user wrote
 
Gender identity is just like any other identity —man, non-binary, etc. However, a gender fluid person may sometimes identify as agender, at other times, as a man or a woman or both. For the gender fluid, gender identity is dynamic and changes from time to time.

I once tried on my sister’s clothes and after that, such cross-dressing continued every opportunity I was alone. I felt like I’d found the long-suppressed inner girl within me. To maintain anonymity, I purchased a few things online, including a wig, female garments, makeup and a short dress. To keep these things hidden, I used to keep them in my office. I especially like the feel of satin saree on me, the smell of female perfume, lipstick, high heels. I want to have my wardrobe full of sarees, dresses and makeup. But 5% of the time, I feel like a male too.""

‘Some days, I feel like a male’
“For me, gender-fluidity means that while I am female-bodied, on some days I feel more masculine. Ever since I was a child, my family thought I should’ve been born as a boy. While I’m grateful to be a woman, I sometimes wonder what it’d be like to have male reproductive organs though I don’t plan to go for a transition. I think I’ve always known that I’m gender fluid since I was a child, but I never knew there was a term for it until a few years ago.”
Amanda Whitworth, a team Lead at a local movie theater, Olympia, Washington State.
 
My gender identity changes throughout the day
For me, gender fluidity is the fluctuation of masculine and feminine energies throughout the day, and sometimes it’s so strong that I even change my outward appearance to match it. So I put on a dress in the middle of the day if I want. I realized my gender fluidity, or at least that I was different in that way when I was 6 years old. I asked my dad if he can ask the doctors to change my body. It was an interesting conversation.

Gender fluidity and androgyny are different
Androgynous dressing refers to clothing and accessories that don’t conform to the typical ‘female or male’ gender norms, which is fast becoming fashion’s new stance internationally. It is mixed-gender clothing that actually can be quite advantageous to those who love experimenting and want to define their personal style without confining to traditional masculine and feminine binaries, enjoy twice as many options, creatively express your fashion sense and encourage equality — so a man could wear nail paint or a woman wears a shirt/cardigan and pairs it with loose pants, as opposed to figure-hugging ones. We introduced androgynous beauty and styles in our global capsule collection launch over a year ago and it received rave reviews, with some looks being absolutely iconic and relevant even today.
Closer home, celebs like Ranveer Singh have experimented with this form of dressing without a care for raised eyebrows. In a society that’s predominantly revolved around strict definitions of masculinity and femininity, androgynous dressing is a fresh, progressive and positive update.”

‘Discovered myself through social media-led awareness’
To be a fluid gender is to be outside the box of binary genders that society imposes on us since the day we are born owing to our genitalia. Ridiculous, because genitalia doesn’t define gender — it’s just a part of our body. Being fluid gender is not a choice of how I’m going to feel today or tomorrow or a week from now. It’s unpredictable. Sometimes, I feel like a girl, sometimes like a boy and sometimes both or neither. I understood myself as a fluid gender when I was 18 years old, after connecting with people from the LGBTQIAP+ community, and talking to them and researching about transgender people.”

‘These terms are so confusing’
When I was growing up and coming to terms with my sexuality, these terms were not there. By using such terms and words, we’re getting more westernised in our approach. We’re trying to increase the misconception in the minds of the people rather than removing it. I have a very traditional mind-set. Imagine that a person like me, who’s been an activist for so many years, is also confused. I can’t understand them. Imagine the plight of others who belong to the LGBT community! First, it was LGBT, then it became LGBTQ, and then LGBTQI, and then LGBTQIA.... I always say that we’re from the sexual minority community or diversity, which includes all these letters. At the end of the day, whether you are gender fluid or non-binary, we all have the same issue and are faced with stigma and discrimination. So why increase the labels and try confusing the society?”

Metro-sexual and evolution of its fashion trends
Gone are the days when a man was considered macho or masculine only when he wore a body-fitting shirt that defined his ripped body and tight pants that accentuated his glutes.
Lately, several men have been adopting metro-sexual fashion trends, with men being qualified as macho even when flaunting a dress on the red-carpet with matching accessories and nail-paint to go. From David Beckham and Harry Style to our own closer home, Ranveer Singh, have been exploring their fashion preferences, challenging the stereotypical brackets of male and female fashion.
 
According to Wajahat Rather, the founder of clothing brand, Raffughar, quintessential metrosexual men are highly concerned with their wardrobe, hair and skincare routine, and fitness regimen. “In short, they’ve a softer side, at least in contrast to the traditional macho image many men aspire to have. He might be a regular at the salon, indulging in everything from massages to manicures without a second thought. He’s no stranger to designer names, frequents boutiques and greatly appreciates bettering himself in every way.”
Adding more information about metro-sexuality, Wajahat points out that though the term was coined in the early 1990s, it was not until the 2000s that metro-sexuality became a lifestyle for many men around the world. “Discussed enough in both the media and on the street today, in practicality the term was first used to describe the single man with a taste for shopping and one who was conscious about lifestyle,” he adds. “The metrosexual of the 1980s was only found in the fashion magazines, but the metrosexual of the ’90s was someone possibly found walking down the street. Then around early 2000s, metro-sexuality became recognised as a lifestyle with an English football icon catapulting on the media scene as a noteworthy metrosexual. The term, however, soon entered mainstream media and not soon after, major publications picked up on it. Suddenly, metrosexual men were everywhere.”

"Hyderabad: Standing under bright fluorescent lights, trying to perfectly crack an expression for an ad commercial was actor Mahesh Babu, supremely eager in understanding the nuance of the take.
In a career spanning over two decades as an actor, Mahesh, who made his debut as a child artist back in 1979, and emerged as a ‘superstar’, gives all credit to his father, veteran Telugu actor Krishna.
 
“All credit goes to my father because he made me do films during summer vacations. I became a child star before I even knew it. In a flash, I completed around 10 to 12 films, some of which were successful. Then, one day, as suddenly, my dad told me you finish your education and then come back to do films,” he said.
While talking about his iconic following, Mahesh summarised his cine persona to the work he has done, saying he takes great pride in the style and mark he has achieved. Talking about his earlier days, Mahesh revealed he felt a huge responsibility to satisfy his father superstar Krishna’s fans. Moving away from his father’s shadow to make a name for himself was a big challenge.
 
“I was my father’s son, who was a huge superstar. I had to satisfy his fans when I did my first film. For me to carry on that responsibility and to fulfil his fans is by itself an achievement,” he said.
Surprised when asked how different acting in movies versus doing advertisement commercials as a brand ambassador, Mahesh candidly confessed that it was the first time he was asked such a question, adding, from an actor’s perspective, both were different.
Excerpts from an exclusive interview.
You are a reserved private person, a family man. Do you watch your movies with your children? How do they respond seeing you dance with a heroine or fight with villains?
 
They don’t like the action part. Whenever a fight scene comes on, they just go out, especially my daughter. But they thoroughly enjoy my films. We watch it at home on the first day of release. It is an amazing experience. When you work so hard, the ultimate reward is to watch the film with your children. I am also very scared because I am very keen to know what they think of my film. So, lots of excitement and nervousness together in one day.
Your son made his debut as a child artist in Nenokkadine. Does he or your daughter aspire to be in films? Would you advise them to be?
 
I don’t know. My wife and I have left it to our children. They are most welcome to do what they want to. My son is in his tenth grade right now and wants to go to the UK to study. My daughter does a lot of things, so I don’t know. Movies are now a really serious profession. When I was young, it was more like a hobby. Unless my children are prepared for such hard work and commitment, I cannot really push them.
In Bharat Ane Nenu, you have played a political character. In real life you come across as apolitical. How do you prepare for such roles which are perhaps not really your type? Did you study any particular politician in preparing, for say, a role like Bharat?
 
I totally give credit to my director Koratala Siva because I really don’t know much about politics. I like to stay away from it. I like to just mind my own business. That said, Bharat is one of my favourite characters, I thoroughly enjoyed playing the role of a chief minister. The director did all the research from which I learnt a lot. But I stay far away from politics.
All your roles have you play a good person in a conventional sense; you are a ‘hero figure’. Will we see you experimenting anytime in future?  
I tried to experiment with my roles in the past, but unfortunately they didn’t fare well. Stars in south Indian films have to cater to a strong audience taste. The stakes are so high and money invested is large, so one can’t really experiment much. So I figured out I have to cater to fans and audiences taste while trying to do something new. We ensure my films have the elements - action, but we have to do it in a familiar way.
 
In a social media era, how do you avoid controversies?
(Ha ha ha) I don’t have anything controversial to offer. I stay away from such issues and mind my own business. Even my friend circle is not too big. I prefer to go to work, then head home and spend time with my family. I stick to the basics.
Everyone wants to know this secret... of your looks and fitness? You don’t grow older than 32?
Don’t stress much. Lead life in a simple way. Diet is very important, then your lifestyle and work follow. Most important thing is to be happy. I learned that from my father. He always has a smile on his face. I have always looked up to him. No matter what happens he just takes it with a smile on his face.

"VISAKHAPATNAM: Ball has started rolling for the Mega Wheel similar to London Eye on the Visakhapatnam Beach Road near D. Ramanaidu Studios. It will be the first of its kind in India and among the 10 giant wheels in the world.
The project is being actively discussed at the chief secretary-level. An expression of interest might be called before this month-end, disclosed Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) chairman Vara Prasad Reddy.
 
“It is a pet project of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. We have suggested that the proposed Sky Tower too be built at the same venue, so that facilities like parking and amenities for tourists are common for both,” Vara Prasad told Deccan Chronicle on Thursday.
London Eye will become a new landmark for the City of Destiny, the designated executive capital of Andhra Pradesh. It will be the first Mega Wheel project in India, which will put Visakhapatnam in the company of major cities of the world. The proposed height of the Mega Wheel is 125 metres, bringing it among top 10 Mega Wheels in the world, APTDC chairman maintained.
 
Incidentally, on October 27, the Chief Minister told his colleagues at the cabinet meeting: “Bringing a London Eye-type project to Visakhapatnam will be a major achievement.”
The wheel will have 44 air-conditioned cabins of 54 square feet each and carry 440 persons at full capacity. The cabins will have automatic photography equipment. Tourists will get their pictures after alighting from the wheel.
The giant wheel, illuminated after sunset, would be visible to seafarers as well as citizens from miles away, Vara Prasad Reddy observed.
 
Ain Dubai of 250 metres height on UAE Bluewater Island is the tallest wheel in the world, followed by High Roller 167.6 metres (US), Singapore Flyer 165 metres, Singapore Marina Centre, Star of Nanchang 160 metres, and China’s Nanchang and UK’s London Eye of 135 metres each.

"Hyderabad: Mandi biryani is gradually replacing the popular Hyderabadi biryani with more and more food-lovers evincing an interest in the dish. Food lovers from the Old City are going crazy as they have to travel all the way to the new city for enjoying the Arabian dish that is available in premier hotels at Gachibowli, Hitech City Tolichowki, Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills. Mandi sign boards dot the vicinity.
“One of the main reasons for people to look beyond Old City is that over there instead of going in for steamed chicken or mutton topping, the chefs are topping up grilled chicken or tandoori chicken on biryani rice. It is sold as mandi and not as mandi biryani,” a chef from a popular biryani hotel in Old City said.
 
“Not only locals, even foreign tourists while at Charminar ask for mandi. We are planning to start genuine mandi for residents of Old city very soon,” Mohammed Javed, head chef of Farasha restaurant said, adding that being adjacent to the iconic structure is boosting their business, thanks to  tourists from all over the world.       
“Earlier I used to take my family to Shadab restaurant in Old City for chowki biryani, but now we have several options close to my house”, Asadullah Baig, a techie fromAsadullah Baig, said.
 
“I have been to UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait where I tasted mandi. I am surprised that some of the top restaurants in Banjara Hills make mandi in an almost similar fashion. The taste is equally good. It is a mouth-watering dish,” said another food lover Afsha Bakali.

"Tenelolike poola balalaku muunnaalla aayuvicchina vaadinedi koredi…

Hyderabad: Thus run the lines in the superhit lyric of Seetharama Sastry in the movie Sirivennela that inadvertently became his surname. These philosophical lines penned by him for the movie Sirivennela in a unique style of cursing the Lord (Shiva) by praise (praising through profanity) carry a profound meaning — “What do I seek from the one (the God) who bestowed the flowers, flush with nectar, with a very short life of just three days, and the boulders with eternal life. What do I ask the first alm-seeker, who gifts ash?”
 
By his outstanding rendition, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam gave these powerful lyrics eternity. Sirivennela, as Seetharama Sastry is popularly known, has immensely contributed to the Telugu tinsel world by making bombastic Sanskritised Telugu words dance to the tunes of the musicians and singers. He has an uncanny knack of embedding expressions that would be hard nuts to crack, yet easily hummed by even the unlettered. This unrivalled art of his is a literary treat to the musicians' instincts. Seetharama Sastry always struck a chord with directors, music directors, musicians, singers and, of course, the audience through his lilting lyrics.
 
Jagamantha kutumbam naadi… eakaaki jeevitham naadi, a song enacted by Prabhas in Chakram, directed by Krishna Vamsi, wells up the eyes of audience even to date. Typical of a wordsmith that he was, Seetharama Sastry made sure his mesmerising lyrics touched the fans of almost every star on the Telugu silver screen. From the legendary Akkineni Nageswara Rao to Megastar Chiranjeevi, the range of stars who enacted the songs inked by Sirivennela include: Krishna, Sobhan Babu, Nagarjuna, Balakrishna, Venkatesh, Suman, Rajasekhar, Jagapathi Babu, Srikanth, and Naga Chaitanya.
 
He has been so contemporary and relevant in the filmy firmament that his latest number Ee dosti, which is already a superhit, is going to enthrall the audience of Rajamouli’s upcoming movie RRR starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR. None else other than Seetharama Sastry could have written something like Puliki — Vilukaadiki; Thala ki — Uri thaaduki; Kadile karchicchu ki — Kasire vadagallaki; Raviki — Meghaaniki… Ee dosti. He helmed in the song the strange and oxymoronic friendships between the combos of tiger-archer; head-hanging rope; raging forest fire-angry hailstorms; and sun-cloud in the song, which was released, that has set the screens ablaze.
 
Several prominent directors, including K. Raghavendra Rao, Ram Gopal Varma, S.V. Krishna Reddy, A. Kodanadarami Reddy, Krishna Vamsi, and so on had him write songs for their movies. Not for nothing he was decorated with the Nandi Awards for best lyrics on as many as 12 occasions, apart from four Filmfare awards. The lyrical peregrination of Seetharama Sastry has touched almost all sections of music lovers of the Telugu movies. The poet, who is for technical reasons called a lyricist, would have bagged a 'Jananpeeth', had the literature of the movie numbers been considered for an award of that stature for literary exuberance. He carved a niche for himself by reaching out to all sections literally like his own song written for Chiranjeevi-starrer Rudraveena, Taraliraada thane vasantham… Thana dariki raani vanaala kosam…
 
Renowned movie director and Dada Saheb Phalke Award-winnerK. Viswanath, who introduced Sirivennela to the movie industry, tapped the potential of the mine of literature and fathomed the depths of Seetharama Sastry’s knowledge and skill to the fullest.
Intertwining innumerable meanings in his songs, by stressing multiple syllables, Seetharama Sastry reached the temporal abode of the God in the celestial world of heaven and turned into a star that he had described in  Venkatesh-starrer Aadavaari maatalaku arthale verule — Allantha dooraana O taraka — himself.
 
Chembolu ‘Sirivennela’ Seetharama Sastry, is a writer extraordinaire who has left an indelible impression among music lovers, without being a musician. Like the lyrics of his songs, he will remain imperishable and immutable in the hearts of the Telugus. He will be greatly missed.

"Hyderabad: When I heard the news about Seetharama Sastry’s demise, and it is heart-breaking and shocking too. It is very difficult to deal with given the fact that we shared a fatherson bond. He met me 20 days ago. He came to my house, we had lunch and he spent quality time with us. He was brimming with confidence
and as euphoric as ever when he came here. He showed no signs of illness.
But never in my wildest imagination I thought that would be the last time I saw
him.
Sastry has always been a free-spirited man. He used to tell me not to give any deadlines to him for writing lyrics, and asked me to give him time to come up with the best lyrics. I too never ever hurried things on him. He used to call me “father”, and never called me a director, as he felt I was instrumental in his journey to fame in films.
 
Such has been our association that we shared stages on various film events, sets, etc. We had great moments and it is hard to pick one. He was a chatterbox and used to tell me not to stop him from speaking his heart, although I tried to control him.
His pen name was Bharani back then. We thought of using that name for my film Sirivennela. But since there was already Thannikela Bharani with the same name, I told him to use his own name (Seetharama Sastry) for the film. He kept telling me that he was forever indebted to me for introducing him to this industry. But it is all his hard work and talent.
 
Sastry used to write songs going far away from the city and people, and importantly, in silent hours of the night.
To me, the best aspects of his lyrics are “celebrating universality yet being aesthetic”.
We have had our contrasting perceptions, but he did not like arguing with me. So he used to smartly put his thoughts through someone else.
Our families are close and we share a great bond. Although I never interfered in his family matters, because of the intimacy he had with me, he used to take liberty and interfere in our family matters. Although we never shared any personal things, our discussions always revolved around cinema, arts and culture.
 
The last time we worked together was for Shubhapradam (2010). He wrote two songs for that film. But he kept asking me, “When are we working again together?” I used to just smile at him.
It is a huge loss to the industry given his style of writing and the values and message his lyrics convey. My heart becomes heavy. The more I talk about him the more emotional I become.

"Hyderabad: Having made his debut as a lyricist in Janani Janmabhoomi (1984), Sastry shot to fame with the song Vidhatha Thalapuna in K. Viswanath’s Sirivennela (1986), and the film’s name eventually became his surname.
In his journey of over more than three decades, Sastry penned lyrics for more than 3,000 songs. A father figure and an authority in the Telugu film industry’s lyrical scenario, he has been an inspirational writer with numerous witty yet profound lyrical compositions.
 
Be it an intellectual masterpiece song like Vidhatha Talapuna or song that has a philosophical touch like Adibikshuvu Vadinedi or contemporary love songs like Ee
Velalo Neevu Emchestu Untaavo (Gulabi) or emotional number like Chilakaa Ye Todu Leka (Shubhalagnam) or a youthful number like Botany Class Undi (Shiva) — he has an uncanny knack of coming with versatile writing Sastry brought a sea change in the way songs have been written in Telugu cinema. Dubbed as one of
the all-time great lyrists, Sastry never ever wasted ink for an obscene word.
 
Dubbed as one of the all-time great lyricists, Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry
brought in classic poetry in film writing. His powerfully evocative lyrics were also very instrumental in the films’ successes. Seetharama Sastry has left behind a legacy of quality and thought-provoking lyrics, which was blended with literary touch yet simply endearing. His sheer magical writing and literary command
made him a force to reckon with in the industry. His song, Maaradu Lokam in
film Ankumram, Niggadeesi Adugu from Gaayam, etc., reflected his times apart from flaunting his rebellious side.
 
Known for bringing out a refreshing change in the lyricwriting in Telugu cinema, Sastry was one of those lyricists who used to express his radical views on society and romance-based poetry in the same breath. An eloquent speaker and influencer, Sastry weaved magic with his choice of lyrics and garnered unprecedented fame.
One of the best traits of Sastry was that he used poetry to give a fresh perspective to songs and worked with the best music directors. He was a legend. There is simply no other term that describes his impact on Telugu cinema. He built his entire oeuvre over his classical literary pieces.
 
The legendary lyricist put together a body of work that is exquisite, unparalleledand magnificent. We may cry and grieve over his songs, but at the endof the day, we also find enlightenment and solace in his songs.
Sastry was only 66 when he passed away but not before he touched our hearts and souls with his song writing. He eventually left behind a great legacy of exquisite and unforgettable songs that make you cry and think.

"Twitter Inc.’s new Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal is now the youngest CEO in the S&P 500, but apparently just barely.
Agrawal, who was appointed Monday to succeed Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, is 37, the same age as Meta Platform Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Citing security concerns, Twitter wouldn’t disclose Agrawal’s date of birth, but confirmed he was born later in 1984 than Zuckerberg’s May 14 birthday. Dorsey, at 45, was already among the dozen youngest CEOs in the collection of the largest U.S. companies.
 
“I don’t think the age thing is that big of a deal, especially for companies like this. It could be an advantage,” said David Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, who studies CEO performance. “The fact that Dorsey is stepping down from the board, so he’s not going to be like a shadow CEO, he must have real confidence in him.”
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. CEO Warren Buffett, is the oldest CEO in the S&P 500 at 91, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average age of a CEO among the 500 largest companies was about 58 years, the data show. But the broader trend in CEO age still doesn’t favor youth. Data on S&P 500 companies measured over the last two decades by executive recruiter Spencer Stuart shows a small but steady increase in the age of the CEO.
 
Agrawal joined Twitter in 2011. Dorsey will stay on the board of the San Francisco-based company until his term expires in 2022, Twitter said Monday in a statement. Agrawal is also joining the board, where he will also be a statistical outlier. The average age of an S&P 500 director is 63, according to Spencer Stuart.

"PRETORIA: A South African doctor who raised the alarm over Omicron said on Sunday (Nov 28) that dozens of her patients suspected of having the new variant had shown only mild symptoms and recovered fully without hospitalisation.
Dr Angelique Coetzee, chairman of the South African Medical Association, told Agence France-Presse that she had seen around 30 patients over the past 10 days who tested positive for Covid-19 but had unfamiliar symptoms.
 
""What brought them to the surgery was this extreme tiredness,"" she said, speaking from Pretoria, where she practises.
She said this was unusual for younger patients. Most were men aged under 40. Just under half were vaccinated.
They also had mild muscle aches, a ""scratchy throat"" and dry cough, she said. Only a few had a slightly high temperature.
These very mild symptoms were different from other variants, which resulted in more severe symptoms.
Dr Coetzee alerted health officials of a ""clinical picture that doesn't fit Delta"" - South Africa's dominant variant - on Nov 18, when she received the first seven of her 30-odd patients.
 
She said South African scientists had by then already picked up on the variant, then just known as B.1.1.529, which they announced on Nov 25.
The news sparked a panicked flurry of travel bans on southern Africa as countries raced to contain its spread - measures the South African government deems ""rushed"" and unjust.
According to a Covid-19 adviser to the South Africa government, symptoms linked to the Omicron coronavirus variant have been “pretty mild” so far.
While South Africa, which first identified the new variant, currently has 3,220 people with the coronavirus infection overall, there’s been no real uptick in hospitalisations, Barry Schoub, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, told Sky News on Sunday.
 
“The cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild-to-moderate cases and that’s a good sign,” said Schoub, adding that it was still early days and nothing was certain yet.
The large number of mutations found in the Omicron variant appears to destabilise the virus, which might make it less “fit” than the dominant Delta strain, said Schoub.
“In a way, hopefully it won’t displace Delta because Delta we know responds very well to the vaccine,” he said.
Meanwhile, Dr Coetzee said it was unfortunate that Omicron had been hyped as ""this extremely dangerous virus variant"" with multiple mutations while its virulence was still unknown.
 
The World Health Organisation has designated it a variant of concern, and scientists are working to assess its behaviour.
The highly mutated variant is thought to be very contagious and resistant to immunity, although its ability to evade vaccines is still being assessed.
""We are not saying that there will not be severe disease coming forward,"" Dr Coetzee said. But ""for now, even the patients that we have seen who are not vaccinated have mild symptoms"".
""I'm quite sure... a lot of people in Europe already have this virus,"" she remarked.
 
Official statistics show that nearly three-quarters of the Covid-19 cases reported in South Africa in recent days have been identified as Omicron.
Since South Africa shared its discovery, a number of countries have detected Omicron infections in recent days, including Australia, Italy, Britain and Belgium.
""We will see a rise in cases,"" Dr Coetzee warned.
The continent's worst-hit country has seen its daily Covid-19 rate jump from 3.6 per cent on Wednesday to 9.2 per cent on Saturday.
Numbers remain relatively low, compared with the world's most affected nations, however, with around 2.9 million cases and 89,791 deaths reported to date.

"NEW YORK: With an expanded definition to reflect the times, Merriam-Webster has declared an omnipresent truth as its 2021 word of the year: vaccine.
“This was a word that was extremely high in our data every single day in 2021,” Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor-at-large, told reporters ahead of Monday’s announcement.
 
“It really represents two different stories. One is the science story, which is this remarkable speed with which the vaccines were developed. But there’s also the debates regarding policy, politics and political affiliation. It’s one word that carries these two huge stories,” he said.
The selection follows “vax” as word of the year from the folks who publish the Oxford English Dictionary. And it comes after Merriam-Webster chose “pandemic” as tops in lookups last year on its online site.
“The pandemic was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,” Sokolowski said.
 
At Merriam-Webster, lookups for “vaccine” increased 601% over 2020, when the first U.S. shot was administered in New York in December after quick development, and months of speculation and discussion over efficacy. The world’s first jab occurred earlier that month in the UK.
Compared to 2019, when there was little urgency or chatter about vaccines, Merriam-Webster logged an increase of 1,048% in lookups this year. Debates over inequitable distribution, vaccine mandates and boosters kept interest high, Sokolowski said. So did vaccine hesitancy and friction over vaccine passports.
 
The word “vaccine” wasn’t birthed in a day, or due to a single pandemic. The first known use stretches back to 1882 but references pop up earlier related to fluid from cowpox pustules used in inoculations, Sokolowski said. It was borrowed from the New Latin “vaccina,” which goes back to Latin’s feminine “vaccinus,” meaning “of or from a cow.” The Latin for cow is “vacca,” a word that might be akin to the Sanskrit “vasa,” according to Merriam-Webster.
Inoculation, on the other hand, dates to 1714, in one sense referring to the act of injecting an “inoculum.”
 
Earlier this year, Merriam-Webster added to its online entry for “vaccine” to cover all the talk of mRNA vaccines, or messenger vaccines such as those for COVID-19 developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
While other dictionary companies choose words of the year by committee, Merriam-Webster bases its selection on lookup data, paying close attention to spikes and, more recently, year-over-year increases in searches after weeding out evergreens. The company has been declaring a word of the year since 2008. Among its runners-up in the word biography of 2021:
 
INSURRECTION: Interest was driven by the deadly Jan. 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol. Arrests continue, as do congressional hearings over the attack by supporters of President Donald Trump. Some of Trump’s allies have resisted subpoenas, including Steve Bannon.
Searches for the word increased by 61,000% over 2020, Sokolowksi said.
INFRASTRUCTURE: President Joe Biden was able to deliver what Trump often spoke of but never achieved: A bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. When Biden proposed help with broadband access, eldercare and preschool, conversation changed from not only roads and bridges but “figurative infrastructure,” Sokolowski said.
 
“Many people asked, what is infrastructure if it’s not made out of steel or concrete? Infrastructure, in Latin, means underneath the structure,” he said.
PERSEVERANCE: It’s the name of NASA’s latest Mars rover. It landed Feb. 18, 2021. “Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet, with a name that embodies NASA’s passion, and our nation’s capability, to take on and overcome challenges,” the space agency said.
The name was thought up by Alexander Mather, a 14-year-old seventh-grader at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia. He participated in an essay contest organized by NASA. He was one of 28,000 K-12 students to submit entries.
 
NOMAD: The word had its moment with the 2020 release of the film “Nomadland.” It went on to win three Oscars in April 2021, including best picture, director (Chloé Zhao) and actress (Frances McDormand). Zhao became the first woman of color to win best director.
The AP’s film writer Jake Coyle called the indie success “a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit. He wrote that it “struck a chord in a pandemic-ravaged year. It made for an unlikely Oscar champ: A film about people who gravitate to the margins took center stage.”
 
Other words in Merriam-Webster’s Top 10: Cicada (we had an invasion), guardian (the Cleveland Indians became the Cleveland Guardians), meta (the lofty new name of Facebook’s parent company), cisgender (a gender identity that corresponds to one’s sex assigned at birth), woke (charged with politics and political correctness) and murraya (a tropical tree and the word that won the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee for 14-year-old Zaila Avant-garde).

"Lara Dutta’s show titled Hiccups Hookups, directed by Kunal Kohli, is about a single mother Vasudha, who seeks a partner through a dating app, even as her 18-year-old daughter is updating her profile on the very app. This dysfunctional–no-filter family, comprising a single mother, her brother and daughter, take on everything under the sun.
We speak to Lara about her role in the series and her thoughts on dating for women at 40. She talks about  the dating arena, how women at 40 navigate their life, choosing relationships (frivolous and casual one-night stands or serious, compatible ones), etc. But unlike her character in the series, does Lara think a single woman at 40 has the right to live her life and seek new beginnings?
Excerpts from an interview:
 
What is Hiccups & Hookups about?
It’s about a no-filter family, a first-of-its-kind show in India, which I believe will open new vistas for such unique content. Single mother Vasu, who’s 40 and separated from her husband of 19 years, shares an open relationship with her brother and 18-year-old daughter Kay. The relationship has been explored completely on screen in a fun, contemporary and an interesting manner. Both mother and daughter get on the same dating app, each seeking a partner. I love how the daughter in the series pushes the mother to follow her passion, saying “Mama, your life is just beginning again.”
 
But women can also fall prey to wrong men on such apps
Yes. But after 40, you can navigate your life. You’re not a teenager. You know yourself though you may or may not know about others. You know your likes and dislikes and what you want. If you seek a frivolous relationship, be clear that what you want is something casual — and that you’re not looking for a life partner. Or understand that you seek more than a casual hook-up or a one-night stand — someone who understands you and is compatible — something stable. I think it’s wonderful because you get to date with far more maturity than you did when you were in your teens and 20s. You may make mistakes, but that’s fine — you just get back up and try again. Sometimes, you’ll get it right and sometimes not.
 
So you think if men can turn naughty at 40 then so can women at 40?
Society has never allowed us to discuss the idea of what the life of a 40-year-old single woman can be. It’s assumed that if you’ve come out of a marriage, you must get married again — you cannot look for casual relationships. Unfortunately, society has constantly dictated that women don’t have the right to even think about this. Even if you have desire, you’re forced to bury it and prioritise your children before yourself. Sadly, this is the real scenario in the life of women who turn 40.
 
You think it is good for a couple to part ways if they are incompatible?
I think it’s better to walk away if you can’t live amicably under the same roof. For the longest time, society has dictated terms especially to women: “Life is not fair; there are ups and downs in every relationship. Suck it up and deal with it.”
Sometimes, it becomes easier for men to continue staying in his marriage. But he has his relationships outside. It’s not an easy decision for a woman to step out of marriage for multiple reasons — either financial security or because she believes her children need her to continue in the bad marriage. But a woman who finds the courage to leave a bad marriage needs a strong support system — be it through her family or kids.
 
What’s happening at your home production? Any particular genre you’re keen on?
We’ve been trying since the COVID. I’m also a very hands-on producer to the dismay of my colleagues in the company. I like to be involved in every step of filmmaking. So for me, it’s not churning out one after the other. I want something very satisfying, which makes me feel excited. I like sitting in on the writing process and casting and all of that. It’s happening although it’ll happen at its own pace. I’m seeking a genre that essentially originates from India but has a global voice, so I can do it internationally.
 
Do you agree that nothing can replace cinema?
Cinema is an integral part of our culture; you cannot take it away from us. In terms of entertainment, it’s our lifeline. While times have changed, it’s very exciting to see all the new types of content. The new crop of actors/directors is going at a faster pace, and the consumption is much faster. I honestly feel March–April 2022 is going to be a boom period, especially because we have had 2 difficult years.

"London: A mutation of the Delta variant of COVID-19, classed in the UK as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) amid concerns of its increased transmissibility, is less likely to display any symptoms, a new real-world study said on Thursday.
The latest results from the long-running Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission [REACT-1] study show the prevalence of the Delta AY.4.2 variant has been growing at a rate of 2.8 per cent a day since September and is driving some of England's high infection rate.
 
The analysis by Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI is based on swab tests taken at home by over 100,000 people in England between October 19 and November 5.
It found that people who were infected with AY.4.2 were less likely to have any of the ÂclassicÂ symptoms of loss or change of sense of taste or smell, fever or new persistent cough and also less likely to have any other kind of symptoms.
ÂWhy it is more transmissible we don't know. It does seem to be less symptomatic,Â said Professor Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme from Imperial's School of Public Health.
 
The data show that only 33 per cent of those with the mutation had these classic symptoms, compared to 46 per cent of those with Delta.
Overall, the study found that infections across England have been falling but are still very high, and are now at a similar rate to January this year.
ÂAlthough hospitalisations and deaths remain lower than previous peaks, the data show that infections across the country remain very high,Â Professor Elliott notes.
ÂThe rate of prevalence has steadily declined throughout this round, but an overall figure of 1.57 per cent is still nearly two-fold higher than that recorded in the previous round. It is possible that the prevalence rate could rise once again now that children have returned to school following half-term, though this could be at least partially offset by as many people as possible having booster jabs when offered and those aged twelve years or over having the vaccine,Â Elliott said.
 
The study also looked at the effectiveness of booster doses at preventing infection, finding that the risk of infection was around three times lower in those who had received a third dose, compared to those who had received two.
For those who were aged 50 and above, having a third dose reduced the infection risk by around half compared to two doses.
ÂThis round of REACT provides another reminder of the effectiveness of the vaccines against COVID-19. As we approach winter, it is vital that everyone eligible comes forward for their jabs Â whether that's their first dose, second or a booster,Â said Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).
 
ÂRemember that anyone over 12 years old is now able to receive their first jab, and boosters will soon be offered to everyone over 40. Please do take up that offer to ensure your immunity does not wane,Â she said.
Looking at trends across the latest study period, infections fell from a very high level during October. However, there was wide variation in the data at the end of the testing period, meaning it's not clear whether infections were continuing on a downward trend by this month.
ÂWhat we can see very clearly is that since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination, death rates have remained low relative to infection prevalence, demonstrating their effectiveness at preventing infections from causing people to become seriously ill and die,Â said Professor Christl Donnelly, Professor of Statistical Epidemiology at Imperial and Professor of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford.
 
Kelly Beaver, Ipsos MORI CEO, added: ÂThe high prevalence found in this round of REACT reminds us all of the importance of remaining vigilant, while the data on booster jabs is an important reminder to everyone to get their booster jab when it's made available to them to ensure the best protection against COVID-19.Â

"HYDERABAD: Although traffic police have provided single-line parking on Abid Road, the area is so busy with shoppers that the parking space is insufficient and most of them are forced to use a second line.
Shop owners are happy that the government has made parking arrangements free of cost. In contrast, further up at Hanuman Tekdi, congestion and traffic chaos are an everyday feature. The area has a number of educational institutions, food outlets and commercial establishments.
 
Meanwhile, the entire RP Road stretch in Secunderabad, which is a commercial hub for industrial equipment, hardware and electrical appliances, boasts of a single-line parking. Vehicles are parked so haphazardly by customers that it obstructs a smooth flow of traffic. Most buildings across the city were granted permission for construction even when they did not earmark parking spaces. In the absence of appropriate planning, it is the locals who are bearing the brunt.
Mohammed Mukrum of FD Khan, a premier clothes store at Abids, said “after the government provided single-lane parking for free, the parking mafia has vanished.”
 
Srinivas, a tailor at Abids, said “from Lazeez café, the lane leading to Rosary Convent is used for parking even though it is a narrow lane. There are no parking facilities at commercial buildings.”
Uday Shah, a businessman from RP Road, said “this is the hub for commercial trade. The one lane parking that has been provided is not sufficient. Adding to the discomfort is that work on the bridge opposite the hugely-patronised dargah has been halted. It is time the government comes up with new multi-storied parking lots in the area and bring all-round respite.

"HYDERABAD: Unregulated and haphazard parking of vehicles seems to be strangulating roads all over the city, more conspicuous and tiresome being near food joints and market places. At popular places like Sindhi Colony, Ranigunj and Diamond Point, roads get shrunk due to the parked vehicles on the side leaving little place for moving vehicles to pass.
A problem that many colonies with compact lanes face is that outsiders park their vehicles irresponsibly in the lanes or behind other cars making it difficult for others to access their vehicles. Even though ‘no parking’ boards with fines mentioned onto them are placed at such places, people pay no heed to such regulations as there is no one to implement it strictly.
 
A few hotspots have also turned into unauthorised auto parking stands, which while being convenient for people who need to hire autos, shrinking the available space. However, the auto drivers think otherwise. “We have lived in this basti for many years now and we have the right to park our autos. However, the roads are also used by second hand car dealers who display cars for sale on the corners of the main road. They need to be questioned, not us. We own this area, we live here and we have the right,” they said.
Footpaths are also not spared by two wheeler users. Places like Begumpet road, Paradise Circle, Prakash Nagar, Sindhi Colony and many others have their footpaths converted into illegal two wheeler parking stands, with no one to check.
 
Security guards outside various restaurants and residential areas say that no matter how hard they try to warn and request people, they do not listen and park their vehicles in no parking area, giving excuses that they will be back in a few minutes or they tend to  pick up a fight. Residents complain that at a few commercial buildings such as CTC, Parklane, around `20 rupees is charged for parking but when questioned, ticket issuers refuse to reveal which authority the fee goes to. However, many restaurant owners help people somehow park and manage vehicles around the shops or in nearby colonies.
 
 
Vox Pop
People come and park their vehicles on the roads. We don’t allow outsiders to park their vehicles in the building. Sometimes they ask us to take care of it by paying us money and we do so. - Srinivas, security guard, Begumpet.
We don’t have parking space for our customers as our shop is on the main road. They park their vehicles on the road leading to traffic jams. - Madhukar, ice store manager, Begumpet.
We have to park our own vehicles far from our house as our parking area is occupied illegally by staff of a nearby hospital. Not only them, others have also started parking their vehicles here and it is difficult to spot who comes from where. - Aman Shah, resident of Sindhi Colony.
 
The lanes here are already narrow. On top of it, several autos parked in the lane cause huge difficulty for others to pass by. Trucks that load and unload products also create traffic jams. - Hamza Tamba, businessman, Ranigunj  
The lanes near Mahakali temple and nearby places are very compact. Also the CTC Parklane charge parking fees from people and when questioned they say it is the boss’ order but they do not know who the boss is. - Huzefa Roha, businessman, M.G. Road.
There are many food joints in Sindhi Colony where my family and I go on weekends, mostly by car. We either wait on either side of the road for an empty parking space. It gets very difficult all the time to find a parking space. - Kiran Lakhiani, who often travels to Sindhi Colony.
 
There are no proper parking spaces at malls, parks, restaurants etc.  Most of the time, I have to park my vehicle far from the place I came for. The government must allot parking places or provide a solution for this. - Mihir S.

"HYDERABAD: Lack of proper parking facilities at wine shops on main roads is adding to the traffic woes in the city especially in the peak evening hours. Boozers park bikes and cars in such a haphazard manner on the roads with scant regard for commuters who rush home after a hard day’s work.
The problems are mostly noted from 6 pm to 10 pm as there are bikes, cars and scooters parked along the road during peak traffic hours. At Kachiguda, wine shops and marriage halls are adjacent to each other and it becomes a major inconvenience during the wedding season.
 
In the evening hours, the same problem is witnessed at several busy areas in Secunderabad including East Marredpally, Karkhana, Tirmulgerry, ECIL and Neredmet crossroads as it often leads to heavy traffic jams. With parking areas sufficient for only 10 bikes, the rest of the vehicles are often parked on the roads in many of the wine shops across the city.
Vijay Naidu, a resident of ECIL says, ""This is a big junction. There are buses and trucks which pass through this way. Even a Scooty parked wrongly can create a huge traffic jam. Despite the police imposing a fine, there is very little change.""
 
In East Marredpally, it has been noted that cars are parked on roads outside homes, reducing the carriageway considerably. Bhaskar Srinath, a resident says, ""For us, it is a daily complaint to the police. Though the police patrol vehicles pass around during evening hours, no action is taken against those who park their cars on roads.""
Near Tarnaka Metro rail station, there is a wine shop and the residents of the adjoining Vijayapuri colony protested against granting licence to the liquor outlet, but it was still granted. The shop is on the main road between a bakery and showroom.
 
Joyce Jacob, a resident of Tarnaka who uses the metro rail says, ""I walk home from the metro station. If I get late, I have to take a share auto as I cannot risk passing the wine shop. Apart from parked bikes and cars, there are people standing all the time. It is very scary for a woman to pass through the area at night.""
Complaints are lodged time and again, online and offline, but there is little relief from the nuisance, say the local residents.

"HYDERABAD: The directions issued by the municipal administration and urban development department to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities to impose a fine of `50,000 for violating parking norms in 2018 seem to have fallen in deaf years.
The state government in March 2018 issued orders to regulate parking fees in commercial complexes. However, none was penalised for violating parking norms. Though the authorities have the right to demolish commercial structures for violating parking norms, the enforcement wing seems to be going slow on its implementation.
 
As per the parking rules, the owner of a commercial establishment has to provide parking space for its employees and customers. The GHMC sources said given the traffic chaos and lack of parking facilities at many commercial establishments, the parking space norms would be revised soon. As per the norms, 44 per cent of a commercial complex area should be set aside for parking. Now, the proposal is to ensure one car park for every 50 sq. metres instead of 80 sq. metres to provide more parking space.
Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, GHMC chief city planner (CCP) S Devender Reddy said the corporation has complete authority to demolish the structure without issuing any notice. He said while granting building permission for a commercial structure, the owner of it should sign an undertaking that he would adhere to the parking norms. Reddy said converting parking spaces for some other purpose was a blatant violation. He also made it clear that cancer hospitals would be given an exception to avoid the radiation. He said this apart, independent houses were also given exceptions. The CCP clarified that the corporation would initiate stringent action on violators if brought to their notice.
 
For the remaining structures, as per the orders, the first 30 minutes of parking at commercial complexes should be free. From 30 minutes to an hour, a person is exempted from parking fees if he produces a bill of any amount that acts as proof that he had shopped in the respective mall or multiplex. Otherwise, the prescribed parking fee for the duration may be collected. Above an hour, a person must get free parking if the person produces a bill or movie ticket whose amount is more than the parking fee. If not, the prescribed parking fee for the said duration must be collected.

"Hyderabad: Umpteen commercial establishments which function without following proper norms on the main arterial roads and innumerable by-lanes across the city, resulting in huge traffic logjams, seem to be immune to civic laws. Neither the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) nor other departments concerned are bothered about the hardships caused by these establishments to the commuters.  
Several commercial establishments including pubs, restaurants, wine shops, grocery stores, tea vending shops and others have been functioning without any objection from the civic authorities despite causing huge traffic mayhem on any time of the day.
 
Vehicles are parked on roads, at times occupying 50 per cent of the thoroughfares, but responsible officials close their eyes conveniently, apparently for personal gain. The civic body can curtail these bottlenecks lawfully by not giving trade licenses, issuing occupancy certificates and by enforcing the GHMC Act, if parking space is not provided at any commercial establishment.
However, lack of coordination between the town planning officials, who approve the building plan and issues occupancy certificates only after verifying the structure, and revenue wing, which issues trade licenses. The rampant corruption in both the wings have been taking a toll on commuters who have to manoeuvre through crammed roads due to haphazard parking.
 
The corporation which recently raided some pubs and eateries in the city found that 90 per cent of them have no trade licenses and 70 per cent of structures were not constructed in compliance with the building norms, where providing parking space is mandatory. Areas like Mehdipatnam, Abids, Himayathnagar, Secunderabad and other busy areas in the city, witness heavy traffic jams due to lack of proper space at these establishments.
Multi-level parking remains non-starter
Though the authorities have initiated measures to construct multi-level parking systems to ease traffic congestion in the city, things do not seem to be moving in the right direction.
 
The state government has appointed the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) as a nodal agency to take up the construction of multilevel parking complexes (MLPC) in the city. It released a GO 187 pertaining to the provision of parking complexes at various suitable locations in the city. It also set up a five-member committee, with HMRL managing director as its convener and GHMC commissioner, HMDA commissioner, TSIIC MD and TSRTC MD as members.
The government has asked HMRL to manage the bid process for development of multilevel parking and asked GHMC, HMDA, TSRTC, TSIIC and other departments to provide suitable vacant lands along metro rail, MMTS, railway stations and bus stations in the city.  The government has asked the committee to study successful MLPC models such as DLF, under the public-private-partnership module by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which developed an automated multi level car parking facility at Sarojini Nagar called South Square. It has asked the committee members to send a detailed project report within three months in 2018. The committee identified 42 locations which were suitable for constructing the parking complexes. After wasting precious time of three years, the HMRL authorities came up with an explanation that the authorities were yet to submit the land details at suitable locations for parking complexes which would be a common point to all public transport systems including MMTS, city RTC and private transport vehicles including cabs. They said the earlier lands identified by the nodal agencies at a few locations were not suitable for parking complexes. They said the GHMC, HMDA, TSRTC, TSIIC and HMRL were in hunt for suitable locations to construct the parking complexes which could be a one stop solution, where commuters can shop, relax, eat and take public transport. 
 
However, the HMRL which is the nodal agency has managed to begin the construction of one multi-level parking complex at Nampally, which can accommodate 250 cars and 100 two-wheelers in three cellars and seven above ground floors. Authorities said the construction of one MLPC was delayed due to Covid-19 but it could hardly see any progress till date. Authorities even informed that the project was put to rest.
This apart, it also proposed to develop an automated MLPC at Khilwat, however, that also remains non-starter. The authorities claimed that no bidder showed interest in the project as it was nearer to Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Chowmahalla Palace, Lad Bazar, Khilwat Palace etc., located approximately 200 metres near the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project area. However, the authorities failed to construct at least one parking complex in three years.
 
A top traffic cop said roadside parking would obstruct the free flow of traffic which might even create a bottleneck. He said motorists had to deal with the issue. He advised motorists to find a nearby parking space within one or two-kilometre radius and park there and come on foot to reach the destination.

"Wildlife species sold in wet markets in China were linked to the emergence of SARS and Covid-19. Now a comprehensive survey of viral pathogens has found they harbor a range of diseases threatening humans and other animals.
A study of more than a dozen species of game animals traded, sold and commonly consumed as exotic food in China identified 71 mammalian viruses, including 18 deemed “potentially high-risk” to people and domestic animals. Civets, the cat-like carnivores implicated in the spread of severe acute respiratory virus in markets in southern China almost 20 years ago, carried the most worrisome microbes, according to the research, released Friday.
 
Although the authors in China, the U.S., Belgium and Australia didn’t find anything resembling SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, they showed that strains carried by bats are transmitted across the species barrier to infect other animals in spillover events that risk seeding dangerous outbreaks. They also found game animals were infected with viruses previously thought to exist only in people.
“This study highlights exactly why the wildlife trade and live animal markets are a pandemic accident waiting to happen,” said co-author Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, in an email. “This paper also shows that humans regularly transmit their viruses to other animals. There’s clearly two-way virus traffic.”
 
Future Threats
The research, supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and others, shows the commitment to searching for future pandemic threats. The 40-page manuscript was released on bioRxiv, an open access preprint repository, ahead of peer-review and publication.
The comprehensive investigation of the diversity and abundance of vertebrate-associated viruses in game animals in China is the first to assess which species have the greatest potential for carrying viruses that could set off an outbreak.
Scientists have yet to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Debate about its genesis has coalesced around two competing ideas: a laboratory escape or a spillover from animals. Studies identifying closely-related coronaviruses, including in bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos and in Cambodia, support the latter hypothesis, especially since live animals susceptible to the infection were known to be sold in markets in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the earliest Covid-19 cases were detected.
 
Exotic Pets
Wildlife species captured in their natural habitats or raised on farms are traded both legally and illegally around the world to meet demand for food, fur, traditional medicines, exotic pets and zoo exhibits. The market in China was worth an estimate 520 billion yuan ($82 billion) in 2016.
China banned the trade after Covid-19 emerged, and the government has subsequently prohibited human consumption of terrestrial wild animals. The move, in early 2020, recognized that the hygiene-poor conditions and close contact between animals and humans, as well as the wide mix of species within live animal markets and the restaurants they serve, create an ideal breeding ground for emerging infectious diseases.
 
Shuo Su, a professor of veterinary medicine at Nanjing Agricultural University, and colleagues examined 1,725 game animals from 16 species commonly hunted or consumed for food across 19 provinces in China. Among dozens of mammalian viruses identified over the past five years, 45 hadn’t previously been described.
“With the exception of pangolins, there has been little investigation of game animals, even though they have close contact with humans and domestic animals and, hence, provide a link to other wildlife species,” the authors said.
Bird Flu
 
Many of the species investigated were displayed on a price list at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, the epicenter of the initial Covid outbreak. Among notable virus findings, the scientists identified for the first time the presence of hepatitis E virus and the H9N2 strain of influenza in badgers and civets.
That particular avian flu virus is now the most prevalent strain in chickens and ducks, and has led to numerous infections in people in China, the authors said. It caused obvious respiratory symptoms in Asian badgers, though an infected civet appeared healthy, they said.
 
The scientists also found a moderate-to-high number of pathogens thought to be human-specific in pangolins, civets and bamboo rats. They included norovirus, a notorious source of vomiting and diarrhea on cruise ships, and influenza B.
Additionally, the authors identified cross-species transmission of several animal viruses, including a bat-associated coronavirus in a civet, a bird-associated coronavirus in porcupines and a pig-associated swine pneumovirus in pangolins. The transmission of a bat coronavirus to a civet is especially troubling, the University of Sydney’s Holmes said.
 
“A further species jump from civets into humans could easily start a major outbreak,” he said, adding that a similar pattern of cross-species transmission is very likely to have caused the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
“The animals sold as game in live-animal markets carry a wide range of viral pathogens,” said Holmes, who was awarded the Australian Prime Minister’s Prize for Science this month. “The right virus in the right animal at the right time could easily trigger a global pandemic.”

"Hyderabad: A memorial for COVID-19 victims, described as the first such tribute in the country to those who succumbed to the infectious disease, was inaugurated at a village in Telangana.
The memorial was installed at Rajannapet village in Rajanna-Sircilla district on Thursday by Project Madad, a voluntary group of Indian and Indian diaspora doctors and professionals.
 
The memorial is dedicated to all the countrymen who lost their lives due to COVID-19 in 2020-2021.
Project Madad believes that ""India cannot afford to forget"" the near and dear ones lost in this crisis nor let down the caution against COVID-19, the group said in a statement on Friday.
The countrymen also need to remember the heroism of all the frontline workers long after the country has been vaccinated and ensure the ongoing welfare of rural healthcare workers, it said.
""To highlight that India's villages bore the brunt of this crisis, the memorial was installed in a village of Rajannapet alongside a marker of the village's covid-resilience,"" it said.
 
A recognition ceremony was held for rural healthcare workers who went beyond the call of duty to ensure 100 per cent vaccination in the village and helped make Rajannapet ""the country's first village to achieve COVID-resilience on July 31 this year,"" the statement said.
The meeting was attended by District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) of Rajanna-Sircilla district Suman Mohan Rao and other officials.
Over a ten-week period in June-July 2021, in coordination with the district health team, Project Madad devised a series of public health interventions that were carried out in Rajannapet village by the village panchayat and local healthcare workers.
 
""This led to a social and behavioural transformation in the villagers' approach towards COVID-19. At the end of the period, when first-dose vaccination was carried out, it saw near 100 per cent acceptance. Attitudes towards testing and vaccines underwent a radical change. The village now stands as a model for COVID-resilience,"" the statement said.

"Hyderabad: The sight of two-time Olympic medallist P. V. Sindhu receiving Padma Bhushan Award from President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday was a proud moment for all Telugu people, besides sports lovers, but would have deemed impossible just 20 years ago, before Pullela Gopichand won the All England Open title.
Looking back at the exhilarating journey he scripted, speaking to Deccan Chronicle, the former champion and award-winning coach Gopichand said, “when I was playing in the 1980s, Hyderabad city was at the bottom rung in badminton even at a south India level. We did not have many serious national-level players.”
 
Recalling the days when Asif sir was the only coach at Lal Bahadur Shastri stadium, Gopichand said, “we did not have an apt ecosystem; we lacked enthusiasm amongst lots of young players, coaches, infrastructure, facilities. In 2001, once I won the All England Open, I felt if a player like me could win, I could share my learning and create that hub to train many a champion.”
Working on a dream to create a great badminton powerhouse which could produce champions for India, Gopichand received land from the state government but lacked funds. He pledged his house to showcase his intent, but a chance encounter would change his, and fate of Hyderabad.
 
“In those days, because of National Games and the Afro-Asian Games, lot of sports infrastructure was built, including the Gachibowli Stadium, KVB Reddy Stadium, etc. But I wanted to create a facility matching the best in the world, the kind I had seen as a player,” said Gopichand.
Entrepreneur and serial investor Nimmagadda Prasad pledged Rs 5 crore over a conversation to fuel Gopichand’s dream to create the fountainhead of sports excellence. Fused, the passion of Gopichand and a carte blanche financial backing from Nimmagadda Foundation helped create the stadium that has now created a plethora of champions – Saina Nehwal, Parupalli Kashyap, P. V. Sindhu, B. Sai Praneeth, Srikanth Kidambi, and in doubles, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty.
 
What makes a champion though? Many factors combine, said P. V. Ramana, Arjuna Award winner in volleyball and Sindhu’s father. “Initially, it is the parents and their support that makes the difference; later on, coaches and facilities, and finally, the players themselves. If Hyderabad is today a powerhouse in badminton, it is because of the extraordinary vision and support of Nimmagadda Prasad and his backing. Once you have a facility like the one he funded, players are motivated and feel ready to take the world stage.”
N. Sikki Reddy, speaking to Deccan Chronicle, before boarding a flight to Indonesia, along with Sindhu and others, said, “the biggest turning point for many players, after the  Nimmagadda-Pullela Gopichand Academy, was the Premier Badminton League. I was part of the winning team owned by Mr Prasad. The entire winnings of Rs 1.5 crore was shared among players and support staff. Money is a crucial support without which players cannot reach their goals.”
 
Speaking about her job with an oil PSU, she added, “it takes between Rs 25 to 35 lakh a year for a player to train, maintain match readiness and to actually go participate. PBL made that difference, and I owe it to mentors like Prasad and the coaching of Gopichand.”
Asked if a combination like this could be replicated in other sports, Mr Ramana said, “If there is a Nimmagadda Prasad like businessperson supporting each sport, India can create many more great players.”

"Hyderabad: ‘My name is KCR and I am not a traitor’; this, in essence, was the crux of the encore of a press conference of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao addressed on Monday at Pragati Bhavan late afternoon.
This was a third press conference that held the attention of people of Telangana within 24 hours and a response to the response by BJP chief Bandi Sanjay to the battleline drawing presser of Chief Minister Rao.
 
In what seemed to be an emotional outburst, Chandrashekar Rao, responded with incredulity at the statements of state BJP leaders terming him a ‘traitor’ for his remarks at Sunday’s press conference about Chinese entering into India’s borders at Arunachal Pradesh and thrashing the Indian soldiers.
In a rare sequel, Rao, addressing a second presser in two days, choose to focus all his verbal fire to attack Telangana BJP leaders, besides also continuing his onslaught against the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre.
 
Rao said he plans to conduct a press conference everyday henceforth, until the BJP gives clarity on his two main demands - namely procurement of paddy from Telangana and withdrawal of cess on fuel.
“It has become a practice for BJP leaders to label anyone as a traitor who raises their voice against their flawed policies and against their undemocratic style of functioning. Since I strongly questioned them about paddy procurement and fuel cess, they are now targeting me and branding me as a traitor. They say I supported China by talking about Chinese invasion of our borders in Arunachal Pradesh. What wrong did I commit? I only questioned the Modi government to protect our borders and sovereignty. I told them they can't sit quietly while China invades our borders. Chinese aggression in Arunachal Pradesh is being widely reported by the media. I talked about it. Who is a traitor? Is it those who alerted the government to stop Chinese invasion or is it those who are sitting silently as a foreigner is invading our country?” Rao said.
 
Rao reiterated that the BJP’s style of functioning is not just to label someone as traitors who question them but also to harass them with income tax (IT), enforcement directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) raids and cases.
Referring to Bandi Sanjay’s comments that they will send him to jail soon, CM Rao said, “BJP leaders are trying to threaten me with I-T, ED and CBI raids and cases. Only thieves will fear I-T, ED, CBI etc. I am not a thief. Whatever I do, I do legally. I have not accumulated any ill-gotten wealth. I file IT returns and pay taxes promptly. I dare them to order raids on me or anything. I am ready to face any inquiry.”
 
Rao came down heavily on BJP state leaders for failing to answer questions raised by him the day before. “Will the BJP government at the Centre purchase paddy from Telangana or not? Will it withdraw cess on fuel or not? Instead of answering, he indulged in personal attacks and talked nonsense. But I will not leave him or the BJP.”
Rao said he was ready to resign as Chief Minister if Sanjay could prove that the Modi government had contributed funds to the sheep distribution scheme.

"What if a simple pill could help heal from Covid-19?
US pharma giants Merck and Pfizer have announced encouraging results for oral drugs, while an anti-depressant has also shown promise in what could open up a new chapter in the fight against the pandemic.
 
What are these treatments ?
They are pills taken orally as soon as the first symptoms of Covid-19 appear, to avoid serious forms of the illness, and therefore hospitalisation.
This form of treatment has been sought since the start of the global health crisis.
After months of research, Merck and Pfizer say they have reached that elusive goal.
Early October, Merck said it was seeking authorisation in the United States for its pill molnupiravir, and Pfizer followed suit on Friday with paxlovid.
They are both anti-virals that act by reducing the virus's ability to replicate, slowing down the disease.
 
Both companies say clinical trials showed a strong reduction in the risk of hospitalisation.
Those who took molnupiravir saw that risk diminish by 50 percent and those who took paxlovid by nearly 90 percent, although direct comparisons of these efficacy rates should be avoided because of the different study protocols.
An anti-depressant which is already available to the public, fluvoxamine, has also shown encouraging results in preventing serious forms of Covid-19, according to a study published in October by Brazilian researchers in the Lancet Global Health journal.
 
Why are they important? 
If the efficacy of these drugs is confirmed, it will be a major step forward in the fight against Covid-19.
They would add to vaccines to bolster the world's therapeutic arsenal against the virus.
Treatments already exist, mostly in the form of synthetic antibodies.
But these drugs, which usually target those who already have severe forms of the disease, are injected and therefore more difficult to administer.
A pill can be quickly prescribed to a patient who will then take it easily at home.
Merck and Pfizer's treatments, which so far have not shown many side effects, would entail taking around 10 doses over five days.
 
""The success of these antivirals potentially marks a new era in our ability to prevent the severe consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection,"" British virologist Stephen Griffin told the Science Media Center.
What limitations ?
It is difficult so far to properly evaluate Merck and Pfizer's treatments given both groups have only published statements and have not made the data of their clinical trials available.
French infectious diseases specialist Karine Lacombe warned in September that these types of announcements should be treated with ""caution"" until the studies can be scrutinised.
 
She pointed out that these treatments represent a ""potentially enormous"" market for pharmaceutical groups.
Nevertheless, some elements indicate that Merck and Pfizer are not making empty promises.
For one, they both stopped their clinical trials earlier than expected as the results were so strong, with the okay of independent monitoring committees.
Where fluvoxamine is concerned, the data is available but is not without criticism.
Several researchers have complained that the authors did not just limit themselves to evaluating the frequency of hospitalisations, but also assessed the frequency of prolonged emergency room stays.
 
This, they say, complicated the interpretation of data.
When? And how much?
Merck's molnupiravir has already been approved in the United Kingdom where health authorities on Thursday gave their green light to its use in patients at risk of developing a serious form of the illness, such as the elderly, obese people, or those suffering from diabetes.
US and EU health authorities are also urgently reviewing the drug.
The European Medicines Agency promised on Thursday to ""accelerate"" proceedings, without giving a firm date.
 
Several countries have already ordered stocks of molnupiravir, such as the United States, with 1.7 million courses of the drug.
The US order gives an idea of the steep price of the drug.
It comes to $1.2 billion, which equates to around $700 for a five-day course.
As for Pfizer, while it has not outlined a price for paxlovid, it has promised it will be ""affordable"" and subject to a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of countries.

"HYDERABAD: Telangana’s floral festival Bathukamma went global on Saturday after it was showcased on the world’s largest screen at Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building in Dubai.
Thanks to the efforts of Kalvakuntla Kavitha, Nizamabad MLC and daughter of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao, the state’s unique culture was showcased and celebrated in a grand manner on Saturday night at around 10 pm giving a visual feast to not only people in Dubai but crores of people across the globe.
 
Kavitha-led cultural organisation Telangana Jagruthi scripted history with the screening of Bathukamma at Burj Khalifa. The screening featured the map of India, map of Telangana, Chandrashekar Rao with Telangana Jagruthi's latest Bathukamma song ‘Allipoola Vennela’ playing in the background as the heritage of India and Telangana came alive at Burj Khalifa.
The slogans of ‘Jai Hind’, ‘Jai Telangana’ and ‘Jai KCR’ on the Burj screen echoed with tears of joy and pride among the viewers. A delegation led by Kavitha arrived in Dubai for the event on Saturday. They received a grand welcome at Dubai Airport from Telangana Diaspora, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) activists and Telangana Jagruthi members. Slogans of ‘Jai Telangana’ and ‘Jai KCR’ were raised as the delegation, which included some MLAs, came out of the Dubai Airport.
 
They witnessed the historical moment of Bathukamma being screened at Burj Khalifa. The delegation included TSRTC chairman Bajireddy Goverdhan Reddy, Rajya Sabha member K.R. Suresh Reddy, MLAs A. Jeevan Reddy, J. Surender, Shakeel Ahmed, and Dr Sanjay.
The screening was also attended by several dignitaries from UAE and was watched live globally on various media platforms. Ever since the formation of Telangana in 2014, Bathukamma has been celebrated as the state festival.
Kavitha and her organisation Telangana Jagruthi have been playing a key role in promoting the festival. This year, she brought together music maestro A.R. Rahman and filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon for a song ‘Allipoola Vennela’ on Bathukamma, which became a chartbuster and went viral on social media platforms.
 
Bathukamma, the symbol of Telangana culture and the Telangana government’s official festival, was celebrated from October 6 to 14. During the nine-day annual festival, women and girls sing and dance around specially arranged flowers. At the end of the festival, they immerse the specially arranged flowers called ‘Bathukamma’ in local ponds.

"Thiruvananthapuram: It has been over 15 years since Nalini Jameela shocked the conventional mindsets of the society and upset the patriarchy by penning a path-breaking autobiography on her daring and frightful life as a sex worker.
Since then, she has been enjoying several identities in life raging from a best selling author and activist to gender expert and social relationship counsellor and now at the age of 69, she is a recipient of the prestigious Kerala State Film Awards.
 
Jameela adjudged the special jury mention for costume-design in the movie ""Bharathapuzha"", directed by Manilal, when the state government awards were announced here on Saturday.
For Jameela, it was yet another unexpected twist which the life had in store for her and she was bold enough to say that the lessons she had drawn from her early life as a sex worker was her base for any new achievement.
""The state award was really unexpected...It was for the first time in my life that I did costume designing for a movie. I cherish this honour as one of the greatest achievements in my life,"" Jameela told PTI.
 
Noting that experience makes a person strong and bold, she said it was plenty of her experiences-whether good or bad, that made her capable to fight all odds and reach this stage of life.
""Bharathapuzha revolves around the story of Sugandhi, a sex worker in her mid thirties, hailing from central Kerala district of Thrissur.
Actress Siji Pradeep played the central character in the woman-centric film, which deals with several gender issues.
""While chosing costumes for the character, I actually saw myself in her... me as a sex worker during my young age. I never used costly sarees or ornaments in life and I do not even like to wear a bindi. I tried to reflect those characteristics in the heroine's physical persona,"" she said.
 
Jameela also said while designing outfits for the heroine and helping her with the mannerisms and body language of a young sex worker, the dreadful memories of the grim past came flooding back.
""I spent days with the film crew, especially the heroine, to provide all support they needed. There were scenes in the film which I could relate with that of my life...,"" the activist explained.
It was her long-drawn friendship with Manilal, the director, that brought her to the tinsel world.
When he had discussed the project with her, Jameela never imagined that she would be entrusted with costume designing.
 
But, she made up her mind to take up the new challenge and managed to complete the work as per the expectations of the filmmaker.
""I worked according to my own perspectives. But, the happiest part was that the director was convinced about what i was trying to say.. He had given me the liberty to follow my mind while designing and selecting costumes,"" the elderly woman added.
A third standard drop out, Jameela was forced into prostitution at a very tender age following the death of her husband who had succumbed to cancer.
While running from pillar to post to look after her family and raise her two daughters, she had no option but to take up sex work as a profession- which the conventional society viewed as immoral and unethical.
 
The years-long life as a sex worker, police brutality, attack by goons and endless physical tortures inflicted by ""clients"", has only given Jameela an added energy to fight the hardships and shatter the taboo attached to sex workers.
Before turning a sex worker and started loitering in bus terminus and railway stations soliciting 'customers', she had worked in brick kilns and domestic help to earn daily bread for her near ones.
When she published the 'Autobiography of a Sex Worker"" in the year 2005 after retiring from sex work, it fast turned out to be one of the best sellers of Malayalam besides kicking up a widespread debate on the plight of the hapless community.
 
After the first book had been translated into several languages including English, she came up with another one ""Romantic Encounters of a Sex Worker"", a memoir which revolves around the relationships she developed with the 'clients', in 2018.
Besides being a member of several NGOs, she has also been working as a gender and social relationship counsellor and taking classes in colleges and universities on the subject.
Asked whether she would like to build a career in costume designing, she said she was not sure whether any mainstream film makers or production houses would give her an opportunity and if anything comes her way, she would definitely give it a shot.
 
She said the changed perspective and empathetic approach of the new generation towards sex workers and the LGBT people is a great solace for the community members.
The 69-year-old woman also cherished a dream of bringing out the cinematic adaptation of her autobiography and setting up a care centre for elderly people.
""Those who came from streets, worked in mud kilns and toiled in someone's backyard as a domestic help will surely have a great strength and courage to fight the odds and shatter the taboos of this patriarchal society,"" Jameela concluded.

"NEW YORK: Superman fell for a reporter and now his son is doing the same, although this time the superhero's love interest is a man called Jay.
DC Comics announced on Monday that the new Superman, who is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, will have a romantic relationship with a male friend.
 
Jon Kent and budding journalist Jay Nakamura struck up a friendship in a story released in August. They will share a kiss in a comic to be published next month, the publisher said, describing Kent as ""bisexual.""
""Following a scene where Superman mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can, Jay is there to care for the Man of Steel,"" DC Comics said.
 
The storyline will feature in ""Son of Kal-El"" issue five, due to hit shelves on November 9, the publisher said in a press release headlined ""Jon Kent finds his identity.""
""Today, more people can see themselves in the most powerful superhero in comics,"" said Tom Taylor, who writes the series.
Fans took to social media to express their joy at the development.
""This news about Superman makes my queer heart glad, knowing the positive impact it will have on so many young folks today & in the future,"" tweeted actor Anthony Rapp.
 
The coming out of America's most famous superhero comes as more comic books embrace diversity.
In March, Marvel Comics announced its first gay Captain America and ""Aquaman"" introduced a Black, gay superhero earlier this summer.
The latest Robin in the Batman comics came out as bisexual in August.
While the new Superman is not the first LGBTQ comic book character, he is arguably the most recognizable.
""Nowadays, we live in a less closeted age. That's an absolute good,"" said Ben Saunders, director of comics and cartoon studies at the University of Oregon.
 
""One consequence might be that the mainstream culture has caught on to what some people have known all along: superheroes have always been, at least potentially, a bit queer,"" he told AFP.
DC Comics made the announcement on National Coming Out Day. US President Joe Biden released a statement saying his administration was ""committed"" to fighting for LGBTQ rights.
In the ""Son of Kal-El"" series the new Superman has already been proving himself a different type of superhero to his father.
He has been fighting a number of social justice issues, including tackling wildfires sparked by climate change and protesting the deportation of refugees

"Palghar: The stress of handling domestic chores as well as taking care of patients at the workplace, fear of contracting coronavirus infection, ill-fitting PPEs, lack of transportation and sanitation facilities are some of the issues that women 'COVID-19 warriors' faced while discharging their duty during the pandemic, especially during the lockdown, says a study.
The study, titled ""A study of gender-based issues on field of Corona warriors amid lockdown"", was conducted by Palghar district Disaster Management Cell chief Vivekanand Kadam and Sarika Kadam. It was recently published in the National Institute of Disaster Management Journal.
 
Although the survey was carried out in Palghar district, those who conducted it feel that these problems were found elsewhere also.
The study talks about various problems that women coronavirus warriors faced during the pandemic and also gives suggestions to resolve some of these issues.
It says that the women COVID-19 warriors have to juggle between home and the workplace. They have to take care of the children and elderly people in the family and also discharge their duty on the professional front, which gives them mental stress. Manpower crunch at the workplace adds to their woes. The fear of contracting coronavirus infection is always there in mind during the duty.
 
They also have to face issues related to menstruation and the unavailability of sanitary pads at the workplace. These women also found it difficult to have meals on time and to take rest due to irregular work schedule. Ill-fitting PPE kits, lack of proper transportation facilities and financial problems are some more issues they have to face, the study says.
The study was conducted under the guidance of research scholar from Sri Lanka, Madhavi Malalgoda Ariyabandu.
The study not only states the problems, but tries to find solutions to them. It says sanitary pads should be made available at the workplace to the female health workers during work, especially in villages, and a separate changing or washroom should be set up. Women should be made part of designing the fieldwork for female health workers. They should be given at least two hours in the day for relaxation from work, it says.
 
Making customised PPEs for women warriors is also necessary as many female doctors and nurses have to wear ill-fitting PPEs, which becomes all the more difficult during the menstruation, the study says.

"New Delhi: The bride, pretty, radiant and in red, sits in front of the sacred fire, her family, the groom and his parents around, the love flowing like a balmy breeze. And in that arguably most precious moment, she looks into the camera and asks -- why must a woman be commodified through the custom of Âkanyadaan', literally Âdonating a girl'?
The ad for a 'lehnga' brand featuring Bollywood star Alia Bhatt as the much indulged daughter and granddaughter has fired debate on social media platforms and elsewhere on the age-old tradition of giving away the daughter.
 
Many term it Hindu phobic for casting aspersions on a ritual that is part of the warp and weft of society, others appreciate it for calling out the patriarchy that underscores the custom and there are those that feel it should have gone even further in its rejection.
""There is a growing number of young women who are beginning to think about the issue, especially as an increasing number joins the work force, has access to ideas (via social media etc) that are critical of 'women as property' concept. This ad reflects that,"" sociologist Sanjay Srivastava told PTI.
 
In the 1.41 minute ad, Bhatt, the self assured woman of today who also does a selfie pout with her father while at the Âmandap', recalls her lifetime of Âothering' in a monologue -- her fond grandmother saying she would one day go to her own home, her father not reacting when people called her ""paraya dhan"" (alien property) and her mother calling her a 'chidiya' which would fly away one day.
The Manyawar ad ends with the grooms's parent also joining in in the ritual (though it is unclear whether they too are giving away their son) and Bhatt's bride saying it should be 'kanyamaan' (respect for the girl child) not 'kanyadaan', and asking, ""Am I a thing to be given away?""
 
Her angst finds wide echo.
Actor Dia Mirza, who decided to do away with the rituals of both 'bidaai' and 'kanyadaan' when she got married to businessman Vaibhav Rekhi, said they wanted the wedding to reflect their ""beliefs and not outmoded ideas"".
""Neither of us believes that women are commodities to be given away or 'donated'. Women have agency, selfhood and can make decisions about their lives on their own so my wedding reflected exactly that by not including a ritual like 'kanyadaan',"" the actor told PTI.
 
She even engaged a woman priest for her wedding to emphasise gender equality.
""It is time for young couples to define how they want to get married and if their ceremony is truly representative of their personalities and love for each other,"" said the actor, who is also the United Nation's National Goodwill Ambassador from India.
The ritual of giving away the bride is, of course, not just about Hindu weddings. It is also a vital part of a Christian wedding service where the father walks down the aisle with his daughter and ""hands her over"" to the waiting groom.
 
Brought up on tradition and a diet of popular culture, including movies both Indian and western, many women have now begun to question the patriarchal traditions of wedding ceremonies across societies.
Mumbai-based IT analyst Meghna Trivedi, who got married in February last year, said the ritual of 'kanyadaan' does not make sense in today's day and age but had to undergo the ritual anyway.
Trivedi, a Gujarati who married a Punjabi, said she asked the priest to find another way but he maintained 'kanyadaan' is a ""must"".
 
""What you mean by Âkanyadaan' is that you're giving away your daughter to somebody else and that is something you have to do in your life and it's related to your duties as a parent that now your daughter belongs to another family,"" she told PTI.
""But I'm still my parents' daughter after I got married... 'Kanyadaan' is like you're giving me away and you have nothing to do with me anymore... You're severing ties like I'm some object basically that you're giving away. My parents did understand it but the issue was 'this is how it is, has been and will be'.""
 
Actor Kangana Ranaut was among those who disagreed.
Criticising the ad in an Instagram post, she said, ""Humble request to all brands... don't use religion, minority, majority politics to sell things... Stop manipulating naive consumer with shrewd divisive concepts and advertising... Please stop mocking Hindus and their rituals...""
A Twitter user echoed similar sentiments.
""Our traditions are not regressive, your mindsets surely are! Kanyadaan is a sacred tradition, where a father/parent parts with their most precious and cherished daughter, a bittersweet emotional moment filled with hopes, promises and dreams,"" the user wrote.
 
Women's rights activist Shabnam Hashmi said the attacks on the ad ""reflect the highly patriarchal mindsets of our society"".
""It is a very progressive advertisement and raises important questions of women's dignity and equality,"" Hashmi told PTI.
Sociologist Shrivastava added that people reacted negatively because there is an increasing intolerance against anything that is seen to question 'Indian traditions'.
The reaction, he said, also reflects a ""male anxiety"" about the changes that are happening in addition to the current climate where it has become difficult to question anything Indian/Hindu.
 
There were also those who felt the ad didn't go far enough.
ÂThe idea should not be to perpetuate the custom but to break away from it,Â said a young woman, who welcomed the ad and the questioning of traditions but would have preferred that it didn't end with the parents of both sides taking part in it.
A radical break would have been more effective in sending out the message, she said.
However, a debate reflects a churn. And in that sense, any discussion is welcome, even if it has unlikely beginnings in an ad for a bridal lehenga.

"Model Kendall Jenner, actor Zoë Kravitz, and singer Olivia Rodrigo in their see-through outfits and highlighted panties at the MET Gala 2021 were some of them. Then at the VMAs, actress Megan Fox and model Hailey Bieber struck a pose on the red carpet in their sheer outfits with exposed innerwear, accentuating their waif-thin physique.
So why are the unusual combinations of couture and exposed underwear suddenly catching the fancy of women in showbiz?
Could lingerie indeed be the next big statement in high fashion? Undoubtedly, in a post-pandemic world, it’s a possibility we can’t deny.
According to designer Ashima Sharma, we are now in a post-Victoria’s Secret era and designers are thinking beyond stylish clothes to make a statement.
“I see it as more than a style statement, with a hidden message about femininity,” remarks Ashima. “More celebrities are opting for sheer at red carpet events or fashion week appearances to look bold and confident. And the basic rule for selecting innerwear to pull off a naked dress is to have the right comfortable fitting that works best for your body type. The corset trends are catching on along with shapewear, and the two are blended to be worn inside a sheer dress.”
Sensual silhouettes
 
Many celebrities have rocked see-through dressing in the past few years at formal red carpet events, making an impression by highlighting their sexuality in daring ensembles. Rihanna, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner, Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande and Katy Perry got popular as sex sirens by pulling off some of these unforgettable ‘naked’ looks on the red carpet.
While adding that in Hollywood, wearing nude underwear inside a sheer garment is a very popular trend designer Victor Robinson believes Bella Hadid is this style’s trendsetter. “Some years ago, Bella wore a beautiful Dior sheer gown with high waist skin-coloured panty, a bold and elegant outfit, which she carried off quite well,” Victor recalls. “These days, international brands like Givenchy, Zuhair Murad and Elie Saab make gorgeous sheer and mesh gowns, and for some celebrities they even make nude bodysuits to avoid mishaps.”
 
Luxe lingerie
The shock-value of see-through sexual dresses for red carpet events has gone down and it’s considered a functional yet stylish trend among global celebrities. Today, every celebrity strives to be a head-turner for the shutterbugs at glam events and to impress fans with their toned bodies and sensuality.

In fact, Abhishek Gupta, founder of intimate lingerie label KamukLife, believes the trend of exposing innerwear is here to stay. Sharing tips to choose the right kind of inner-wear while donning a transparent dress, he adds, “When wearing a transparent outfit, some of the best innerwear options are embellished thongs, suspender style lingerie, body stockings under the sheer dress and leather lingerie. The trick is to choose the correct fit, size and colour that match the final outfit.”
However, Abhishek recommends that one always try the ensemble in advance. “Ensure the attire is comfortable and fits the body perfectly to avoid any wardrobe malfunction,” he adds.
 
Bold and beautiful
Calling it an audacious move in fashion, Anshu Gupta, co-founder of the label Elgante, says, “I’m all in for ‘sheer without fear’ and ‘flaunt your panty’ trends in fashion. You just need to play with contrasts and choose silhouettes that suit your personality.”

Anshu also speaks of choosing the right kind of briefs, control-top bottoms, camis and shapewear for ultimate comfort in a body-hugging dress or one with thigh-high slits. “Wear high-waist briefs to cover your lower half while still showing some skin, so that they cover your bottom and stomach area and look sophisticated,” adds Anshu. “Go for seamless undergarments made without elastic and create the illusion of smooth lines and flaunt them under silhouettes with risky cuts. You can also balance a pastel-coloured outfit with printed lingerie, neon shades or contrast colour panties to show off your body with confidence.”

"Nagpur: They say politicians rake in crores, but Nitin Gadkari earns in lakhs. Check his YouTube videos and you'll know.
Gadkari recently said he gets Rs four lakh every month as royalty from YouTube, as viewership of his lecture videos posted on the popular video streaming platform has increased during the pandemic period.
 
An aide to the senior Union minister told reporters that the earnings from YouTube may not always be as high as the sum he mentioned, but they are substantial as he has a large, dedicated following, always awaiting new videos for his frank some say brutally frank views on diverse topics.
And the videos are aplenty. The aide says Gadkari addresses anywhere between five to seven Âwebinars' daily from his residences in Nagpur or Delhi and has so far held around 1500 such virtual interactions during the pandemic.
Soon after the first national lockdown was imposed, Gadkari started addressing events and various programmes through video links. Starting from April 2, 2020, Gadkari has been a part of almost 1500 such events, reaching out to crores of people across India and abroad, the aide says.
 
Gadkari has 92 lakh followers on Twitter, 16 lakh followers on Facebook, 13 lakh followers on Instagram, and two lakh followers on YouTube. Content monetisation has helped him earn big bucks from YouTube.
While the topics he has touched in the online interactions range from the Âgym to the gem' sector, as the aide says, Gadkari holds forth with equal vigour while speaking on cooking as he does on the expressways he has built.
Gadkari, a self-proclaimed foodie, says he started cooking at home during the pandemic.
His YouTube channel began in 2015 but has become more active during the pandemic. It has all his speeches, press conferences, and media bytes garnering thousands of views. Those who like the videos also tag them, bringing more viewership.
 
Gadkari was invited by international organisations, universities to deliver speeches virtually during the pandemic and all those videos were uploaded on his YouTube channel, the aide says.
In these virtual interactions, Gadkari's approach is to ask people to convert adversity into opportunity, the aide says. Through his numerous webinars, Gadkari has interacted with chambers of commerce, economic forums, students, scientists, entrepreneurs, foreign investors, and Indians abroad.
Two Nagpur-based journalists, Rahul Pande and Sarita Kaushik are bringing out a book titled 'Unmasking India' after going through almost 500 of these webinars. They said the book is a compilation of amazing thoughts articulated by Gadkari on Aatmanirbhar Bharat.
 
Pande said Gadkari has had online interactions with leading doctors, engineers, policymakers, and secretaries in most state and Central government departments. These people shared their problems with Gadkari, who guided them towards solutions, he said.
The range of topics covered is diverse, from micro, small and medium industry to agriculture, forestry, transport, and green energy.
Gadkari not only interacted with prominent builders or real estate sector players but also reached out to Gadchiroli district tribals who collect honey and tendu leaves for livelihood.
 
During his online lectures and interactions, Gadkari has spoken of his road map for cluster-driven growth along highways, with equal stress on boosting agriculture and creating value out of farm and forest produce to bring economic prosperity in rural India, Pande says.

"Turns out cows can be potty trained as easily as toddlers. Maybe easier.
It’s no bull. Scientists put the task to the test and 11 out of 16 cows learned to use the “MooLoo” when they had to go.
 
Just like some parents, the researchers used a sweet treat to coax the cows to push through a gate and urinate in a special pen. And it took only 15 days to train the young calves. Some kids take quite a bit longer.
“The cows are at least as good as children, age 2 to 4 years, at least as quick,” said study senior author Lindsay Matthews, an animal behavioral scientist at New Zealand’s University of Auckland who worked with colleagues on the tests at an indoor animal research lab in Germany.
What started with a half-in-jest question on a New Zealand radio talk show about the very real problem of livestock waste resulted in a serious study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. And it wasn’t just a “wow, this could be fun” academic question. Massive amounts of urine waste is a serious environmental issue, Matthews said.
 
Urine contains nitrogen, and when mixed with feces becomes ammonia, which is an environmental issue with acid rain and other problems, Matthews said. It can also taint the water with nitrates and create the airborne pollutant nitrous oxide, he said.
And cows do pee a lot. A single cow can produce about 8 gallons (30 liters) of urine a day, Matthews said. In 2019, nitrous oxide comprised 7% of all the U.S. greenhouse gases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I am not surprised they can train calves to urinate in set locations, but I am surprised no one has demonstrated this before,” said Duke University animal cognition scientist Brian Hare, who wasn’t part of the research. “The critical question is can it and will it scale?”
 
If it could be done, toilet training animals makes it easier to manage waste products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said Donald Broom, a professor of animal welfare at the University of Cambridge in England.
At the lab in Dummerstorf, Germany, the researchers mimicked a toddler’s training, putting the cows in the special pen, waiting until they urinated and then giving them a reward: a sweet liquid of mostly molasses. Cows do have a sweet tooth, Matthews said. If the cows urinated outside the MooLoo after the initial training, they got a squirt of cold water.
 
Then in two sets of experiments, the researchers let the Holstein cows roam about the indoor facility. When they had to urinate, 11 of them pushed into the pen, did their business, and got their sweet reward.
There are a couple caveats to this experiment.
No. 1, they gave diuretics to the cattle to get them to urinate more because they had limited time to run the experiments under ethics guidelines.
And No. 2, they didn’t do No. 2. They only trained cows to use the MooLoo to urinate, not defecate.
Urine is a bigger problem, at least in Europe, Matthews said. But he predicted they could train cows to poop in a certain place too.
 
While dogs, cats and horses can be toilet trained, they already show the desire to go in special places, but cows don’t, Matthews said.
The biggest environmental problem for livestock, though, is the heat-trapping gas methane they emit in belches and flatulence, a significant source of global warming. The cows can’t be trained not to belch or fart, Matthews said: “They would blow up.”

"Hyderabad: When a politician loses, the author within awakens. The aphorism seems tailor-made for Jairam Ramesh, who had a couple of books before 2004, a single anthology during the UPA era between 2004 and 2014, but has eight books after Narendra Modi took office.
Staggering output, marked by an exceptional range of themes and topics added to his oeuvre, his latest and unimpeachably his most ambitious work already being acknowledged a masterpiece, Jairam acknowledges the irony. “The author in me will be grateful to Modi. He gave me the time to reflect on ideas, subjects and themes I always wanted to but being in power meant not being able to find time for. These books, one after the other, dealt with subjects I had a special fascination for.”
 
Yet, none of his books were only about dabbling with the subjects and penning reflections. The biography of Indira Gandhi was a unique perspective of her life and love for the environmental. His work on P. N. Hanskar, delved deeply into the quintessential top-bureaucrat who held more influence and sway that perhaps any other, and easily a benchmark for any future work to analyse a bureaucrat in retrospect.
The work on V. K. Krishna Menon, who Jairam says was both controversial and consequential, not only merely rekindled interest in a life of the man, but unleashed strong emotive response from readers. Given the manufactured, fashionable anger of today against the first prime minister, and the animosity and fear of China, the work on Menon went on to become a hit.
 
It is here, surprisingly, Jairam Ramesh abandons his comfort zone. A bit like Buddha.
In selecting a work on a subject not contemporary, a perspective sui generis – he was not writing about Buddha but undertaking to do a Boswell, not on a person but a poem. The poem itself was remarkably powerful, and influential; and in telling the tale of its conception, its creation, its impact and influence, Ramesh found his highest inner calling sufficiently inflamed.
A few days after the pandemic had taken stranglehold of our lives and the Prime Minister announced a nation-wide lockdown (March 24, 2020), I started my research, he narrates.
 
It took him almost six months of intensive research. Post the research phase, he started accessing online archives across the world, digitally. Across specific resources in the UK, Russia, the USA, and Germany, even the Vatican library. He lucubrated for three months, and after keying in 120,000 words, had achieved the first draft.
The author in him is batting with the strike rate of Kohli, I quip. He laughs his slightly immodest acknowledgement. “From the time of the idea to starting the research to writing and editing the book to its launch – I am clocking it at around 12 to 14 months a book. But now I am done… will take a break,” he says.
 
He presents the easy part of the challenge first. “Having so much of scholarship and having access to them in a lockdown digitally made it easy. Any study of Buddhism has this great advantage, it has always been friendly to scholarship.”
But the sense of urgency work was driven more by the emotional attachment, special empathy and passion for the subject than availability of material.
Why Buddha?
The book will be special every Indian because Buddha is in the Indian DNA. There is a Buddha in every Indian cultural context. Most Indian homes and public places have a carving or statue of Buddha. Yet, fascinatingly, this bond is cultural, not theological.
 
Buddhism as a religion, India’s greatest export to the world, besides yoga, has long been severed from India at large, but Buddha has a living presence. It is a localised Buddha, different in many a myriad ways from the Chinese, Japanese or Korean Buddha. Buddha, of course, has many incarnations and each land he has found a prominent place, has its version. The Lankan or Cambodian Buddha is known but even Afghanistan, Central Asia, even as far as Russia or Persia, we have Buddhist accounts. He is revered as Dalia Lama to the Tibetians.
 
Biography of a poem?
The poem, ‘Light of Asia’, by Edwn Arnold has a curious life and journey of its own. Published in 1879 by the English civil servant posted in India, the historiography of Buddha has had an epic impact, both in India and abroad.
It has been translated into multiple Indian languages – interestingly, sometimes as verse, at times as prose. It is popular in Gujarati, Sindhi, Hindi, Bengali and Tamil. Popularising the life and teachings of Buddha, it was published in Telugu, I found out, in 1902 as a poem titled, Buddha Charitaramu, by Venkata Shastry and Tirupati Shastry. It was commissioned by the zamindar of Pollavaram – Bahadur Kotcharlage Krishna Raju. The Punjabi translation is in prose while it is in poetry form in Hindi and Malayalam.
 
Global influence
Sir Edwin Arnold’s poem, ‘The life of Buddha’ focuses on the humanity of Buddha not his divinity. This idea brought Buddha into global focus because for many of his followers, he was a preacher and a reformer, not a God. Sir C. V. Raman rated the ‘Light of Asia’ as one of the three most influential works of his life.
Sir Arnold was an extraordinary Info-phile. He was well versed of Mahabharata and the Gita Upadesha, which he composed as poems in 1885. The ‘Song celestial’, was the first avatar in which Mahatma Gandhi discovered the Gita, a text he always carried with himself till his death.
 
What makes Buddha’s appeal so enduring and universal?
In fact, the Church was very angry with the success of ‘Life of Buddha’. They commissioned Arnold to write one on Jesus Christ, ‘Light of the World’ but there were few takers.
The reason for the appeal of this poem, and the icon, was that during the times it was written, there was growing disenchantment with the church. The disbelief in God was increasing, with economic prosperity came inequality and people were looking for a system of personal morality, and beyond, for hope.
 
Buddha fulfilled the need. Everyone found in Buddha something they wanted, needed. Buddha as understood by Swami Vivekananda, Tagore, Gandhi, or Nehru were not same. But Buddha became to many an Indian at that time a figure to establish India’s spiritual superiority over imperialist England. The nationalist movement was seething with this feeling. They argued that we Indians may be have been subjugated by the West, but we are superior in civilisations terms and therefore we can interact from a positon of equality.
The reading of the poem and understanding its impact therefore necessitates that we do not, and cannot, divorce the content of the poem of its historic context.
 
So while Vivekananda and Gandhi saw in Buddha an icon of spiritual richness of India, there were others, looking for icons from our own history to establish a grounding for other ideas. Like equality of all humans. Social revolutionaries who attacked caste and Vedic orthodoxy from Sri Narayana guru or D. D. Kosambi and Dr B. R. Ambedkar. Thus was Buddha was simultaneously a spiritual, a cultural and a political icon. For reformers, Buddha was a figure who attacked the caste system.
Buddha’s teachings
There are many aspects to his teachings but in essence Buddha opened in a new way an old Indic wisdom – you can reach the divine through several ways, among them gyana (knowledge), yoga (meditation, self-realisation), karma (actions) or sanyasa (renunciation).
 
Buddha was preaching that you must be your own experiment, be your own lighthouse. You could follow Buddha without being a Buddhist. He provoked enquiry into the roots of social ethics and individual morality. He did not seem to say I have answers as much as I will encourage you to find your own answers. Be your own searcher. It was a very modern and scientific method.
In fact, after the contemporary animosity, by the eight century, Brahmins appropriate him and a century later, he was dubbed the ninth Avatar of Vishnu, possibly sensing the growing threat of Buddhism.
 
Buddha – spiritual or political icon?
Consider this. Why did young prince Siddhartha abandon his kingdom? There are several views. One thread of history argues he was disenchanted by the war between various princely clans over water. After he failed to bring in reconciliations, he was vexed, a bit of a la Marxist aversion to status quo, which pushed him to seek a path of revolution of sorts.
At the spiritual level, Buddha enlightens us that Nirvana as a concept is not a negative but one which demands a positive and active engagement with life in all contexts. Most Indians build their worldview from our twin Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. Buddha feels like a natural extension of several of these themes.
 
Today, and for the last century, we can violence rocking societies that accepted the Buddhist theology. Japan’s role in the World War II made them the darkness of Asia. There have been several other instances of political abuse of Buddha.
Both facets of Buddha are relevant today. Social reform is always incomplete. We have abolished untouchability but so much of discrimination still exists. I feel more connected to and inspired by the side of Buddha that spoke to Dr Ambeddkar.
Nehru loved Arnold’s ‘Light of Asia’ whereas Gandhiji was a lover of ‘Gita’, both by the same author. The English and several Europeans sensed in Buddha a kind of reformer, a kind of Jesus. He was a like a Protestant reformer to them.
 
But what is in little doubt is that Buddha was one of the greatest figures of human history, and Sir Arnold’s ‘Light of Asia’ one of the most important works of and for humanity.

"Hyderabad: Meghana Musunuri, founder-chairperson of Fountainhead Global School and Junior College is the first person to be part of Google's ‘Women Entrepreneurs on the Web’ and who has completed all five circles of the program.
Winning the Global Teacher Prize Award is akin to a Nobel Prize for her.
 
“Teachers are extremely passionate but the recognition that they get is limited. It is very important to be out there and tell the world what all you are doing and that makes the difference,” she said in an interview with Deccan Chronicle. Excerpts:
How did you get into teaching?
On returning to India from London, I started the school as I was very passionate about teaching. Moreover, my roots are here. That is what made me to come back and integrate new-age technology and teaching. It was experimentation, so to say. With Google, we developed teaching tools and started using them from 2012 onwards. I have been operating my administration on Google, which was new then. We trained our teachers, staff and blended technology with education to bring out the best in us. Last year, when the pandemic forced a shift from offline to online classrooms, we hardly faced any difficulty in the transition as we were using these tools for long. I had teachers and educators from other schools who wanted to know how we did it and they are learning from our experience.""
 
Did the Global Teacher Prize Award take this initiative into account?
The award looks at your overall contribution to society. It takes into account how you have made education interesting for students and also how it has helped them in real life. There were lots of rounds and lots of parameters before they closed in on 50 teachers. The school has worked towards reviving the Meedi Kunta Lake and that contribution is very important. Apart from contributions from me and my faculty, children used money meant to celebrate their birthdays for saving the lake. These real-life aspects have enriched the experience of teaching. We believe that locally we must make an impact and our efforts towards that helped in reviving the lake.
 
You teach social studies, English and maths. These are three different subjects. How do you manage?
Social studies as a subject is labelled ‘dry’ and often children wonder what they would do by learning history. The onus is on teachers to make it interesting and create a learning curve that can help shape one’s future. We have created tools, samples and also practical models to make it interesting.
Similarly, children fear maths but our effort has been to mix maths and art. This has produced amazing results. I strongly believe that a teacher should strive to handle multiple subjects. In fact, I encourage all my teachers to teach different subjects as it evolves their respective teaching abilities.
 
Are you looking forward to more interviews for the Global Teacher Prize Award?
Yes. There are more interviews lined up and I am looking forward to it. Next in the line is a round for the top 10 category globally.

"Could anybody believe that there is a cellular jail in Hyderabad akin to the Kalapani of Andamans?
A structure which ranks among the rare buildings in the country is so close, yet out of bounds for people of Hyderabad. The military prison built in 1858 for erring British soldiers is just 100 feet away from the Tirumalagiri X Roads towards Sainikpuri. Even those who commute on the road daily may not be aware of its importance. The building now belongs to the Indian military and it is difficult to get permission to visit it.
 
It is said Kalapani, the notorious cellular jail on the Andaman Island, constructed nearly 50 years later, was modelled on the Tirumalagiri military prison. The Gothic structure with four arms stretching in cardinal directions looks like a cross from above. The ground floor has 40 cells, while the first floor has 35. Covering 2,260 square yards, its construction cost was Rs 4.71 lakh.
While the Andaman jail was used for Indians, convicted British soldiers were housed in the Tirumalagiri prison where each cell has three strong iron doors with arrangements to chain prisoners to the walls inside. Each cell has a window which allows the prisoner to see only what is directly in front of him, while someone from outside can view the whole cell through it. It is said that this is a unique feature of cellular jails.
 
Above the cells is the hanging chamber and a small prayer hall. To offset any human or mechanical error while implementing the death penalty, it is so arranged that the body, after loosening the hanging rope, falls on sharp irons at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep well.
Records show that nearly 500 death penalties were executed at the prison. Several soldiers were imprisoned here during World War II. After the Operation Bluestar in Punjab, some Indian soldiers were also kept in this prison, which has been in disuse since 1994.
It is now in the control of the 125 Infantry Battalion of the Territorial Army.
 
From the top of the jail building, the surroundings appear like a forest with big trees. It is a relief to know that the city is not a concrete jungle altogether.

"Washington: New research led by Ohio State University suggests that feeling like leisure is wasteful and unproductive may lead to less happiness and higher levels of stress and depression.
The study was published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
 
In a series of studies, researchers examined the effects of a common belief in modern society: that productivity is the ultimate goal and time's a-wasting if you're just having fun.
People who most strongly agreed with this belief not only enjoyed leisure less but also reported poorer mental health outcomes, said Selin Malkoc, co-author of the study and associate professor of marketing at Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business.
""There is plenty of research which suggests that leisure has mental health benefits and that it can make us more productive and less stressed,"" Malkoc said.
 
""But we find that if people start to believe that leisure is wasteful, they may end up being more depressed and more stressed.""
One bright side: Some sceptical people could enjoy fun activities if leisure is part of a larger goal and not an end in itself.
""If leisure can be framed as having some kind of productive goal, that helps people who think leisure is wasteful to get some of the same benefits,"" said study co-author Rebecca Reczek, professor of marketing at Ohio State.
In one study, 199 college students rated how much they enjoyed a variety of leisure activities and completed assessments that measured their levels of happiness, depression, anxiety, and stress.
 
They were also asked how much they agreed with five statements assessing the degree to which they believed leisure is wasteful (such as ""Time spent on leisure activities is often wasted time."")
Results showed that the more the participants believed leisure to be wasteful, the less they enjoyed leisure activities.
That was true whether the leisure activity was active (exercising) or passive (watching TV), social (hanging out with friends), or solitary (meditating).
In addition, the more they thought leisure was wasteful, the lower their levels of happiness and the higher their levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.
 
In one study, 302 online participants were asked what they did to celebrate Halloween a few days after the holiday in 2019. Some of the activities they could choose from were fun for their own sake, like going to a party. Others served a larger goal, such as taking your kids out trick or treating.
The participants were asked to rate how much they enjoyed their Halloween experience.
Results showed that those who thought leisure was more wasteful reported less enjoyment of activities, like parties, that were only about the fun.
""But those who participated in fun activities that fulfilled responsibilities, like trick or treating with your kids, didn't see such a reduction in how much they enjoyed their Halloween,"" said study co-author Gabriela Tonietto, an assistant professor of marketing at the Rutgers Business School.
 
The negative view of leisure is not just an American issue. One study, which compared people in the United States, India, and France, found that the French were less likely than those in the U.S. and India to believe leisure was wasteful - as is consistent with cultural stereotypes.
But for those in France who did disdain leisure, the bad effects were the same.
""We live in a global society and there are people everywhere that hear the same messages about how important it is to be busy and productive,"" Reczek said.
""And once you believe that, and internalize the message that leisure is a waste, our results suggest you're going to be more depressed and less happy, no matter where you live.""
 
The researchers were struck by how the negative views of leisure affected the enjoyment of anything fun, no matter the situation or how short the leisure activity was.
In one study, college student participants were asked to watch a short funny cat video in the middle of other parts of an experiment. Some read articles beforehand that touted leisure as a way to manage stress and increase energy. Even then, the same effects persisted.
""These are students who are coming into the lab to answer surveys, which can be boring. In the middle of that, we give them a funny video to watch, which you would expect would be a nice break - and even then, some participants didn't enjoy it as much,"" Malkoc said.
 
""They had no way to use the time more productively. We were giving them a break from other, more boring activities. And still, those who believe leisure is wasteful didn't think watching the videos was as fun as others did.""
The study showed it is not easy to change people's beliefs about the value of leisure. So a different approach may be needed, the researchers said.
For those who believe leisure is wasteful, ""it may be helpful to think about the productive ways that individual leisure activities can serve their long-term goals,"" Tonietto said.
 
In other words, connect each leisure activity to something you want to accomplish, she said.
""Find ways to make fun activities part of a larger goal in your life,"" Malkoc added. ""Think about how it is productive, instrumental, and useful.""

"Pune: A farmer from Solapur in Maharashtra has approached the district administration seeking permission to grow ganja (cannabis) plants on his farm, saying the contraband fetches a good rate in market and claimed there is no fixed price for any agricultural produce.
However, the district administration forwarded the farmer's application to police, who termed it as a ""publicity stunt"".
 
The cultivation of cannabis, also known as marijuana, is prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
Anil Patil, the farmer from Mohol tehsil in Solapur, in his application sent to Solapur district collector on Wednesday, said there was no fixed price (MSP) for any crop and hence, the agriculture business was running into losses.
""As agriculture produce fetches a pittance, farming is turning out to be difficult. Even the input cost of cultivation of any crop is not recovered. The dues of sugarcane sold to sugar factories are unpaid,"" he said in the plea.
 
Claiming that there was a good price for ganja in the market, Patil sought permission to cultivate it on his two acre land.
He also asked the district administration to give him permission by September 15 to grow ganja plants on his farmland, failing which he would start the cultivation from September 16, presuming that he has been given the nod for it.
""If any offence is registered against me for ganja cultivation, the administration will be responsible,"" he said in the application.
However, Mohol police station's senior inspector Ashok Saykar said the farmer's application was just a ""publicity stunt"".
 
""If he resorts to such an act (cultivating ganja), we will register an offence against him,"" he said.

"Tokyo: August 7 was a day of pride for India when Javelin Thrower Neeraj Chopra secured the Gold Medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with a mighty throw that scaled 87.58 metres. The 23-year-old became a star overnight and was lauded across the country, and even abroad, when his winning feat was named as one of the 10 most magical moments in the history of track and field.
However, what most Indians don’t know is that Neeraj’s medal is not the first Olympic gold we’ve won in Javelin Throw. Another Indian athlete has won it twice already - first at the 2004 Athens Paralympic Games, and then again at Rio 2016. 40-year-old veteran Devendra Jhajharia remains the only Javelin Thrower (Olympic or Paralympic) to secure two Gold Medals at the premier event. 
 
Kicking off on August 24, the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics will be a special one for Indians as the country sends a strong contingent of 54 athletes, almost triple the number of athletes as compared to the 19 sent to Rio De Janeiro in 2016. The flag-bearer will be javelin thrower Tek Chand after Mariyappan Thangavelu came in contact with a COVID positive person days before the premiere event.
Now as we move on from the Olympics to the Paralympics, here is why India should pay a bit more attention to the event. 
India’s vibrant history at the Paralympics
 
Although the first edition of the Paralympics was held in 1960, India’s first involvement in the mega event wasn’t until 1968, and then winning our first medal at the 1972 games in Heidelberg, Germany. After a 12-year hiatus, the country’s Paralympians returned for the 1984 Games in Stoke Mandeville in the United Kingdom and have been part of the Summer Paralympic Games ever since.
Much like the Tokyo Olympics, India is sending their largest contingent for the Paralympics, which in itself is a matter of excitement. The country sent 19 athletes across five sports, and the contingent left Brazil with a record tally of two gold, one silver and one bronze. This year, 54 athletes will compete across nine para-sports – Archery, Athletics, Badminton, Canoeing, Shooting, Swimming, Powerlifting, Table Tennis and Taekwondo.
 
Jhajharia, along with High Jumper (F42) Mariyappan Thangavelu were the two Gold Medallists at Rio 2016, and both will be looking to defend their titles in Tokyo. Meanwhile, leading the Paralympic Committee of India will be Deepa Malik, who was a Silver Medallist in the Women's Shot Put F53 category in the previous edition of the competition.
India has won a total of 12 medals at the Games; Four Gold, Silver, and Bronze each. And with India sending a big group of athletes this year, the prospects of medals increases plentiful. The leading prospects include Para shuttler Pramod Bhagat, who is the World No. 1 in his category (SL3 - standing/lower limb impairment/minor) and enters the competition as a favourite.
 
Avani Lekhara, who features in four events, leads the shooting contingent. She will be looking to improve upon her silver medal at the 2019 Para Shooting World Cup. Avani’s colleague Rubina Francis (women’s 10m air pistol SH1), with a world record to her name, is another medal hope.
READ HERE: 10 Indian athletes to watch out for in Tokyo
The aforementioned names are just a few of the participating Paralympians in Tokyo, but the sheer size of our contingent is an indication of the growing support for Paralympians in our country. Each one of these para-athletes has overcome many trials and tribulations to reach the stage that they have, to represent India at the highest level of the sport. 
 
With the Sports Ministry and the government backing these athletes, it is now time for the common people of India to get behind our country’s Paralympians as they get ready to thrive under the bright lights, following their compatriots who participated at the Tokyo Olympics.
What are the various categories of the Paralympic movement?
There was a 12-year gap between the two medals for Jhajharia and the reason for this is neither illness nor injury, but because his particular category F46 was not on the competition schedule in Beijing 2008 and London 2012. Once it was reinstated back for the Rio Olympics, Jhajharia did not miss his chance and broke his world record to win an unprecedented second gold medal. 
 
“I had to wait for 12 years after winning my first gold medal in 2004. I made the most of the opportunity and bagged my second gold at Rio de Janeiro. I don’t want to miss this opportunity in Tokyo,” Jhajharia said to olympics.com.
The different categories of the Paralympians are based on their particular impairment within the 22 sporting events that are scheduled to take place in Tokyo. The movement covers 10 impairment types that fall broadly into three categories: physical impairments, vision impairment and intellectual impairment.
 
Some sports are open to athletes in all categories, and others are reserved for specific impairments. Athletes are assessed within each category to see whether they meet a minimum impairment level, to ensure equity among the Olympians in a particular event. 
For example: In sports like athletics, the athletes are placed in certain sports classes, pitting them against other athletes with similar impairments to ensure equity. Hence, the category F46 for the likes of Jhajharia and other amputees like him. But athletes may be reclassified over their lifetime as their situation changes.

With the stage set, now all these Olympians need is our love and support in what will undoubtedly be the biggest moments of their careers.

"KAKINADA: Former Amalapuram MP Harsha Kumar’s son and young Congress leader Sri Raj has created a flutter by killing a bird (quail-Kouju), to match with the image of the Twitter logo bird, and sent the “fried bird’’ to Twitter offices via post.
He did this in protest against Twitter suspending the account of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. The entire action was video-graphed, and he posted it onto his Instagram page. He also informed this to the Congress office.
 
He said in his message to the Congress office that this protest was staged by Congress leader Harsha Kumar from the state and his followers raised slogans in favour of Rahul Gandhi and against the BJP. After posting a part of the fried bird, we ate the remaining pieces,” he has stated.
The Pradesh Congress disciplinary committee and the All India Congress Committee’s communication wing took a serious note of the incident. Sources quoted the committee president Lingamsetty Eswararao as saying such protests would hurt the image of the Congress party.
 
From Mahatma Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaders maintained a high degree of decency in their conduct. The AICC communication wing, therefore, suspended Sri Raj from party membership, it was stated.
Harsha Kumar told Deccan Chronicle that the incident took place as a mark of protest.

"HYDERABAD: Just a day after India celebrated her Independence Day, an Afghan citizen who completed his Bachelor’s degree from Osmania University interpreted the meaning of freedom during a candid rendezvous, in the midst of a national crisis in his motherland. “Hyderabad is like heaven on earth, people are friendly, there is no restrictions and there is so much safety even in the middle of the night,” he said.
Wahidullah Seerat, a resident of Badakhshan, a province located in the north east of Afghanistan, said after the American troops left Afghanistan, the Taliban soldiers, who have increased in number, occupied the province. “When they entered, they said they would not harm us, we can live as we were, but should follow Islamic law. Later, they started beating people, and killed those who did not listen to them. women without burqa or hijab were foulmouthed and threatened to shoot them if they spot without hijab,” he said.
 
As soon as the Taliban took over the province, music, movies and dances were banned, but there was no restriction on social media, he added.
“Taliban forces are asking for money as taxes from traders as well as common people based on their wealth, which are much higher comparing to the regular taxes,” he said.
Seerat, who completed his Bachelor of Business Management at Nizam College in 2020 Hyderabad on December 2020. He was the president of Afghan Students Association, Hyderabad, with around 400 native students during his stay.  
 
He said freedom in India and Afghanistan could not be compared. “India is like heaven for us, we have so much of freedom, no restrictions at all, people never bothered us. We all used to feel safe even in the middle of night. Before landing in Hyderabad, I never knew that freedom will be so beautiful,” he said.
If given a chance, he said he would come back to Hyderabad and would bring his mother, brothers and sisters too.  “I miss Hyderabad, I miss India. I love the Hussainsagar, as I used to live in Mallapally, whenever we get time, we used to visit this place. Dosa is our all-time favourite food. It used to be our breakfast each day,” Seerat said.
 
“Our lecturers have become our close friends, Madam Swapnika Jaiswal, who used to teach business law was friendly with everyone of us. When these crises happened many of the lecturers called us and spoke and enquired about us,” he said.
He said food prices have shot up in Afghanistan, and scarcity of food and necessities was growing.

"Mumbai: In the last two years, the Covid-19 pandemic has played havoc in people’s lives. While some lost their loved ones, many lost their jobs or had to adjust with steep salary cuts; there were also many who went under debt to pay for the hospital bills of their loved ones, while many are still reeling under post-Covid complications and paying for the treatment with shrinking savings.
One key factor why situations became tragic, more than they should be, was the lack of financial planning. While those who had been saving rather than spending managed to somewhat sail through, the worst affected were those with slack financial planning.
 
With the country celebrating its 75th Independence Day, here is a broad plan that one could follow to achieve ‘independence’ from financial worries. Financial freedom is described as a state where you simply don’t need to work anymore because you have enough money coming in from your investments to live on in the foreseeable future.
The first step is to identify and finalise your financial goals—for example, child’s education, marriage, buying a house or creating a retiring corpus,—decide the timeframe for achieving the goals and arriving at an estimated cost to achieve each goal. Then comes saving, investing, growing the money and reviewing it periodically.
 
Says Balwant Jain, a tax and investment expert, “One should plan for achieving financial independence early in life. For example, saving 10 per cent of your pocket money every month when you are still studying.
The actual planning should start when you receive your first pay cheque. Though you can plan yourself, you should ideally take professional advice because everyone cannot master every field.”
You should know what is your income and how much is the outflow due to expenses. Your household expenses should not be more than 30-35 per cent of your income. The idea is to set a minimum savings target of 25-30 per cent of one’s monthly income to meet your future goals.
 
Create an emergency fund to take care of your six months of expenses in case you lose your job.
Buy life and health insurance: A serious injury or a disease can wipe away all your investments and savings and derail you from the path to financial freedom. Therefore, buy a term life insurance with a sum assured at least 12 to 15 times your annual income. You should also insure yourself and your family for medical emergencies by buying a health cover that covers each family member for minimum Rs 10 lakh, or insure all the members through a family floater health insurance of minimum Rs 15 lakh and buy a Super Top-Up plan (that comes cheap) to supplement your base cover. Similarly, a personal accident insurance cover, a critical illness policy is a must. And yes, don’t buy these as riders.
 
Become debt free: Repay your debt using your existing assets. For example, if you have money invested in fixed deposit, bonds or gold, then you could look at liquidating them to pay your existing loans. Pre-pay loans with the highest interest rate first. Banks charge an interest rate ranging between 24-48 per cent on credit cards and these should be paid first, next would be personal loan, followed by home loan.
Review your portfolio: This is equally important, says Anil Rego, a certified financial planner, “Continue working towards your goal and periodically review the progress. Any significant life change such as change in a job or marriage should also take into account the necessary change in the estimated cost in achieving a goal. Several investors do not review their investments in stocks and lose the right opportunity to sell their investments and book profits.”
 
Diversify: Equity helps in providing inflation-adjusted return if held for a long term. Go for a Systematic Investment Plan in equity mutual fund and put some portion in debt and gold.

"Hyderabad: Finding a semblance of normalcy in life after a pandemic that pushed our world towards seclusion – when quarantine and self-isolation became medical recommendations for staying safe – as India as a nation celebrates its 75th independence day, poet, thinker, gay activist and academic Hoshang Merchant – a midnight’s child, as old as our independence – reflects on the coinciding evolution of the life of a poet and a nation.
Prof Merchant released his life’s most comprehensive collection, an opus, and the best slice of his oeuvre – Rebel Angel – in the midst of the worst health crisis of over a century, an ongoing existential war – and tasted triumph, the book emerging as a bestseller.
 
As he appears on a scheduled Zoom call window, he resembles a seasoned actor auditioning for the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, wrinkled white skin, magnetic eyes, sharp nose and an unmistakable voice. Or given the Indian-ness he reaffirms with every idea and sentence, maybe he should be seen as an aghoori sadhu amongst Parsi priests.
He is old, as old as Independent India. He sounds sad at times, yet exudes mischief, child-like curiosity, youthful energy, and coquettish humour. Sharp and devilish in putting down rivals and bad ideas, he speaks his heart out on his life, literary journey, losing innocence and finding it all over again.
 
Q. Being born in Mumbai in 1947…
A. Bombay (he corrects).
Q. How fortuitous was it to be born, as a Midnight’s Child, in Bombay, in 1947, to the direction and plot of your life? How did you feel when it became Mumbai?
A. Monumental. Bombay was a westernised thought of India; and a microcosmic model of what many in that generation believed the rest of India would become like. Over 70 years, India has become many things but not really like the Bombay I was born in. When Bombay was renamed as Mumbai, it felt like sectarian and chauvinist tendencies won. We must respect transition, as Tagore observed, based on the determinism of people; after all, ‘we, the people’ are the three most powerful words in the Constitution.
 
But I resent the renaming of Bombay. India lost when and Bharat asserted. I resent every renaming because I see it as a violation of history.
Q. You are a proud Indian. Why would you resent a post-colonial reassertion of an indigenous culture?
A. The word cosmopolitan comes from the times of the Roman Empire, where the provinces tried to imitate the mothership, Rome. But Bombay was not an imitation of imperial London. It was a new India’s mixture, a bhelpuri of regional cultures, a cosmopolitan ideal being constructed amalgamating varied cultures, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil and so on, even as migrants from every corner of the country came and melted into its fast-paced life, trying to find opportunities and success. Bombay was not a relic of cosmopolitan imperialism, it was a future-looking melting pot.
 
Q. So Bombay was India’s best living example of the Independence era idea of India?
A. Yes, we are being post-colonial. Of course, there were relic of the past trying to assert themselves, the aristocracy of old money and spirit but the city was being shaped by a modern, progressive thinking middle-class; the city throbbing with life and modelled on the rebellious, curious, possibility-filled mood of a mid-western American university.
Q. On cue, universities. As a professor, how do you see the happenings of our universities in the last few years?
 
A. The siege of our universities makes for a good headline, but it is not recent. Wasn't the JNU under siege for over five decades by the leftists? We have known reports of lady scholars who did excellent work with a right-wing slant, not getting opportunities or rewards commensurate with their work. They would not be promoted, they would be blatantly denied opportunities. The dictatorship of the Left is no less dangerous.
Of course, as we saw since the fatwa was issued on Rushdie, religious right-wing autocracy is equally dangerous, even if it is a narrow-minded puritan imitation.
 
Q. When did you realise you are gay and how did it impact your life?
A. Pretty early. It must have been in class five. Once my parents realised it, I was given psychotherapy. My mother would beat me violently… for a sexual crime of thought. It traumatised me. I knew, however, that I was attracted to men and it made me lonely. Then hypocrisy began to manifest. Our Parsi community has a way of doing things… do them silently. My father had a mistress which all of Bombay knew, except my mother. Then I was sent abroad for education.
 
Q. Did you find any significantly higher intellectual sexual freedom in the West?
A. I left before I was 21. I was sent to Occidental College, one of the most expensive private colleges, and I wasted my privilege to express my anger against my father, because he was paying for the education. It was an elite experience. I returned after only a nine months course to take care of my mother, who passed away. It was the darkest phase of life.
Q. Did writing afford a safe place?
A. Poetry snarls an angry heart and a hurt soul. I studied English literature, finished my bachelor of arts - English honours course. I was reading Auden and T S Eliot. I did my Ph. D, but was not writing much till I turned 23, except for coursework. My doctorate was on Anaïs Nin, Henry Miller’s girlfriend, essaying, novelist and erotica writer.
 
Even in literature freedom has eluded though authors, poets and thinkers have claimed it, after a bitter fight, again and again. Look at the issue of acceptance of erotica as an acceptable genre in literature. Anaïs fought for it and reduced the gap between pornography and literature.
I went to America as a young dream poet. I was so stupid to actually believe the streets of USA were paved with gold, instead I found blood and pain of exploitation of Red Indians and the Blacks. Poets are literalists of imagination.
In 1968, I did not find America to be a land of the free for a young man to be gay. Truth is, social reality takes a long while to change and we have to fight for our worldview every single day. It is the same for LGBTI, the same for women, for Dalits.
 
I am aware of my privilege, a man from the social elite, powered with language, but what the rest of the people. An author lives in the mind. Poets don’t live in the society, they are born as a soul empowered to select a society of their own, to paraphrase Emily Dickenson.
Q. In that sense, every writer is a rebel against society, against status quo, trying to imagine a different world?
A. Society allows for good ideas to win but slowly, far too slowly. And some people don’t have the time. What if a gay author is also a Black or Jewish? It can become a double or triple whammy. We in India today are freer today as genders go. My sisters were freer than my mother but they too had to struggle all over. But my sisters could become freer because they were daughters of my mother, who could fight for them too.
 
But authors are not the only rebels seeking change. Everyone suffering is. Some succumb, some retreat into madness, and some win. Authors capture the angst.
Q. Finally, your latest work has got critical attention. How important is it for you?
A. For any writer – it is just the word that matters. In the Bible, the genesis is the naming day, when Adam was named, plants and animals got named. The act of naming is the act of creation, the identification of reality. Words are power but they can be used to abuse; the weapons of the anti-poet. I believe in the sacredness of words. I wanted to capture all words, not just as a poet but also my prose to get together as an anthology. It means life to me as an old man in the dusk of life. It has found resonance. It is an inter-linked collection of 20 years of words, from the earliest to most mature pieces. Indulge me, I want a little fame before I die (laughs).
 
We are seldom truly free, except in the arts. We will never be truly free in this world because society is out to catch you and put you in a box. A box suits the world. But a poet fights on, because only when we are free, can we free others. Empires will fall, words will last.
Q. As India touches 75 years of Independence, and you turn 75 too, what does the country mean to you?
A. We are a Hindu culture, the only surviving ancient cultures. We should not confuse Hinduism, a great wise culture of the world, as a religion. To do so would be an insult, to shame it. But to politicise it is a shame too.
 
Q. Will end with a question of love – as a gay, I notice so many women falling in love with you. What is the secret?
A. (Starts laughing). As an Indian, I benefit from the perception of instant approval for fair complexion. Gay men are sexually safe… we are pretty sentimental. I talk of love all the time and the romantic myth of the poet comes in.

"VIJAYAWADA: Apprehensions over a probable third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, limited muhurats in Sravan month and unavailability of auspicious days till October are forcing prospective brides and grooms to tie nuptial knots in a hurry.
Only 13 auspicious muhurats are available in August and hence majority of families are performing marriages of their children following Corona protocol fearing a third wave in the coming days. The lockdown restrictions during the second wave of Covid-19 prevented families from performing wedding of their children in April and May despite availability of auspicious muhurats.
 
The Andhra Pradesh government issued orders putting a cap on the number of people attending wedding ceremonies and other functions to only 150. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed officials to implement the orders strictly and impose fines and stern actions against violators.
The Coronavirus cases started decreasing largely for the past few weeks from earlier 20,000 infections per day to 2,000 infections per day. According to pundits, auspicious muhurats are available on August 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27 and on September 1. Pundit M Gopal Sastry said there were no auspicious muhurats till October end, hence majority of families are performing marriages of their children in a simple manner. Gopal Sastry said 50,000 marriages would be performed in Andhra Pradesh in 13 days.
 
A trader, R. Ajay Naidu said his relatives were performing marriages to their children on August 19, 25 and 27. He said the Corona third wave warning turned a big worry to families as they were feeling that the third wave would not allow any activity in the coming days.
An organiser S Venkat said weddings became a simple affair as the government put huge restrictions on all functions. He deplored that wedding-related trade and businesses reduced due to the Corona lockdown impact which affected thousands of people who were dependent on wedding ceremonies and related functions.    
 
The medical and health department officials appealed to people to follow Covid-19 protocols without fail in all functions including marriages. Dr J Yasmin and other medical experts warned that there is a big threat of huge spread of Covid-19 infection due to shunning of Corona protocols and appealed to the people to wear masks, do sanitisation, keep physical distance and to shun big functions considering them as social responsibility.

"Tokyo: They set records everyone saw coming and others that surprised the experts.
They suffered, and battled, and spoke their truth in ways that hadn't been heard before.
 
Over nine days at the near-empty Olympic Stadium, the women of track and field delivered a memorable show, both inside the lines and out.
These are some of the athletes who defined the meet in Tokyo: Allyson Felix, Sydney McLaughlin, Sifan Hassan, Raven Saunders, Elaine Thompson-Herah.
Theirs was a sport in need of a good boost, not only because of the year-long delay sparked by the virus, but because no matter when they returned, Usain Bolt would no longer draw eyes to the track simply by showing up.
The women delivered Â not so much with the feel-good, dance-a-minute vibe that Bolt brought, but with a series of inspiring performances and messages that showed the heart of their sport was still beating strong.
 
Some highlights included:
ÂHassan and her unrelenting journey toward three medals Â two gold and one bronze Â in three of the longest races held on the track.
She started with gold in the 5,000 meters, then came back with bronze in the 1,500. She closed the show Saturday with a gold-medal run in the 10,000 Â one in which her vision was so clouded by exhaustion that she admitted she could not see the finish line.
ÂI'm so happy,Â she said after the odyssey Â six races over eight nights covering 65 laps and 24 kilometers Â was finally complete ÂI'm relieved. I'm finished. I can sleep.Â
 
ÂMcLaughlin, whose back-and-forth duals in the 400-meter hurdles with U.S. teammate Dalilah Muhammad reached a crescendo at the Olympics.
It was a race that had been much-anticipated and all but preordained to again reset the world record that one or the other had broken in three previous showdowns.
And they lived up to the hype. McLaughlin lowered her own mark to 51.46 seconds. Just as impressively, Muhammad's silver-medal time of 51.58 would have been a world record, too.
ÂI think it's two athletes wanting to be their best,Â McLaughlin said, Âand knowing there's another great girl who's going to help you get there.Â
 
ÂThe sprinters were fast through the leadup to the Olympics, so it wasn't all that surprising to see that pace keep going in Tokyo.
But while most of the pre-Games buzz went to Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100) and American Gabby Thomas (200), each of whom briefly staked their claim as the second-fastest women in history at their respective distances, it was Thompson-Herah who wound up there in the end.
After a slow start to the season because of an Achilles injury, Thompson-Herah swept the 100 and 200 sprints for the second straight time. One more like that and she'll match Bolt.
 
She ran the 200 in 21.53 and set the Olympic record in the 100: 10.61 seconds. Though that record might not be the most formidable of the marks Florence Griffith Joyner set a generation ago, in 1988, it had been around every bit as long.
Flo Jo's world records of 10.49 and 21.34 still stand. But for how long?
ÂBy the Olympic finish, I'll probably see what I've done,Â said Thompson-Herah, who at 29, assures us she is not done yet. ÂAt this moment, I'm just a normal girl.Â
ÂThe story of Raven Saunders was inspiration for anyone who has been overlooked or left behind. The Black, gay American shot putter started wearing ÂIncredible HulkÂ masks to the field Â a way of projecting her fierce competitive spirit, but also a lighter side underneath.
 
After she received her silver medal, Saunders crossed her arms and formed an ÂXÂ on the medals stand. ÂThe intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet,"" she explained.
It was the sort of message many believe should not only be tolerated,, but embraced, when Olympic athletes get their all-too-short time in the spotlight. The IOC, which after much debate and discussion over the past two years still chose to ban such demonstrations, said it would look into it. Any probe was set aside when Saunders' mother died unexpectedly only hours after she won the medal.
 
ÂAnd Felix closed the show.
For five Olympics spanning 16 Â make that 17 Â years, she was epitome of class and speed. At 35 years old, she called it a career, but not without doing what she does better than any runner alive: Winning medals.
Her bronze in the 400 and gold in the 4x400 relay gave her 11. She now has more than any track athlete in history, save a Finnish distance runner, Paavo Nurmi, who won 12 between 1920 and 1928.
Felix has more to do. Since having her baby, Cammy, in 2018 she has transformed herself into one of the most outspoken advocates for women in sports.
 
ÂI feel like it's definitely been a journey for me to get to the point where I guess I had the courage to do so,Â Felix said.
She earned the platform with two decades of racing in which she won some, and lost some, and kept on coming back for more.
Now, it's time to see who takes her place.
Earlier in the meet, someone asked Muhammad, the hurdler, what she thought about all this women's dominance at the track - of America's seven gold medals in track and field, they won five.
ÂWomen do it better,Â she quipped.
 
After watching them conquer records, overcome obstacles and make their messages heard over nine days and nights at the Olympic track, it was hard to say she was wrong.

"HYDERABAD: Mohammed Mansoor Khan, popularly known as the ‘manja maker from Hyderabad’, became just memories. The 90-year-old breathed his last on Sunday, surrounded by his family members at his residence Manju Maya Ka Tabela, Mata Ka Khidki, at Dabeerpura, in the Old City of Hyderabad.
He is survived by his seven sons, and one daughter.
 
“I was absolutely fond of him and used the manja made by Mansoor Khan. I have been seeing him since my childhood making manja. His passing is a matter of grief for me, and many others,” said Mohammed Hafeez, a businessman who lives in the same area where Mansoor Khan lived.
“Just last week he was discussing how we should start making manja early this year. With many schools and colleges still closed, he felt that youngsters would take to kite flying early this year and not wait till January when the festival comes around,” Mohammed Jawed Khan, one of the three of Mansoor Khan’s sons who worked with him in manja making said on Monday.
 
For many of his fans, Mansoor Khan was nothing less than the curator of manja, and the tradition of fighting kites - made from cotton string with a paste made from coating of gum, crushed glass, and Kalamanda (aloe vera).  The advent of the now banned ‘Chinese manja’ – made from synthetic string - did little to diminish the demand for Mansoor Khan’s ‘Hyderabadi manja’. Almost every shop that sells kites, would stock this fighting kite string and sellers would come from all corners of the state to buy it in bulk for resale in their localities.
 
Mohammed Safiullah, Managing Trustee of Deccan Heritage Trust who enjoys flying kites, said, “I used to purchase manja from Mansoor Khan Sahab, who was famous for Hyderabadi manja. We had to wait for hours for our turn, as one person used to purchase several kinds of manja. I preferred the Gandhak Manja made by him. With his demise, we lost a person who served for so many years in every community, regardless whether they were adults or children, making kite flying an exciting sport.”
“He made the Manja for 73 years. My father started when he was 17, and he never stopped,” Jawed Khan said.
 
Mohammdi Begum, his daughter-in-law, said, “He was a loving and kind man, always friendly with everyone, fond of children. He used to encourage kids to fly kites.”
Venu Gopal Bajaj, who has been in the kite business for the past 50 years at Gulzar Houz, said, “Mansoor Khan’s Manja is considered the finest thread for kite fights. A genuine man. So many people would ask for the Hyderabadi manja.”
“I am 55-years-old, and I have been working with my father since the time I was 12. He was always a hard worker. It was not just the popularity of manja, but his goodness towards those around him that saw a large number of people attend his funeral yesterday at the Bada Kabristan in Naga Bowli, Yakutpura,” Jawed Khan said.

"HYDERABAD: Alam, a processional standard of Moharram, stolen from Hyderabad 18 years ago is among 14 works of art to be returned by the Australian government to India.
The alam was stolen from the Aza Khana Zehra, Darushifa, and is being returned by the National Gallery of Australia (NGA).
 
The antique alam was stolen on the night of April 11, 2003. The Hyderabad police could not trace it. The Rein Bazaar police had arrested two suspects but the case was closed citing lack of evidence. The stolen alam was made of panchaloha (five metals) and gold coating. There was a necklace made of precious gems.
The last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, had installed the alam at the Aza Khana Zehra in 1956 in memory of Bibi Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Mohammed. The Aza Khana Zehra is a historic landmark built in memory of the NIzam’s mother Amtul Zehra Begum, also known as Madar-e-Deccan (Mother of Deccan). The monument is used by the Shia community for mourning the death of Imam Hussain Ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet, in the battle of Karbala. Now the Aza Khana is under the management of Nizam Trust.
 
Dr Safiullah, managing trustee of the Deccan Heritage Trust, and deputy chief executive officer of the Wakf Board, welcomed the decision of the Australian government to return the alam. He hoped that the Union government would hand it over to Hyderabad for reinstallation at its original place. The state government should coordinate with the Centre to bring back the alam when it returns to India, he said.
